Assignment 1 for ODU CS 733 - Natural Language Processing

The first cell is pip installations because my computer doesn't have these packages/libraries. The first cell doesn not have to be run for the rest of this assignment.

The second cell is for importing these libraries for the rest of the cells

To be fair for this project, I wasn't familiar with the nltk library or the wordcloud library so I had to look at some resources for better understanding.

Resources that helped me:
