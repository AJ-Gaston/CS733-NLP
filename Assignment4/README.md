# Assignment 3 for ODU CS 733 - Natural Language Processing

## Author: Alexji Gaston

Cell 1 is where I import my python libraries for the rest of the jupyter notebook. 

Cell 2 is where I read in my datasets. I used the pandas library to read in the ham-spam csv file and the os library to read in all the files inside the wikitext-2 dataset folder.

Cell 3 is a sanity check to see what types these are for later work. This is not necessary to run.
