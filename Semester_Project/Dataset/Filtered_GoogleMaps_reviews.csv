Tribal Axe,"5070 Virginia Beach Blvd Suite B, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"Great Time doing something ""different"". Axe throwing isn't your typical ""bowling"" night, but with a good group of friends it's very fun! I've gone here twice & both times were good experiences.  The staff if friendly. They have good drinks & solid food. The staff even occasionally joins in on the fun. If you want to do something a little more unorthodox than the typical night out... try Tribal Axe.",en,en,,,4.8,2025-11-23T19:47:57.892Z,128

We rented out Tribal Axe for a private corporate group event and it was amazing!  Great food, good drinks, nice staff.  The instructor taught us what to do and kept safety in mind the entire time.  Our group enjoyed the afternoon out and would recommend it to others!  It was a nice bonding activity and there were other games for those that just wanted to hang out.

Tribal Axe,"5070 Virginia Beach Blvd Suite B, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"What a fun time! We had the best experience axe throwing! From the moment we walked in to the time we left, everything was positive, fun, and just a great time all around. The woman who checked us in was so sweet and immediately made us feel welcome—she joked around with us and set the tone for the night.

The bartenders and servers were awesome, and super friendly. We were honestly surprised by how good the food was — it was way better than we expected! Usually places like this don’t focus much on food, but this was honestly better than a lot of sit-down restaurants we’ve been to.

The axe throwing coaches were super helpful, and fun to talk to. You could tell they really enjoyed what they do. Honestly, every single employee we interacted with was great and seemed to love working here.

Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for something fun, laid-back, and surprisingly delicious! We will most definitely be back!",en,en,,,4.8,2025-06-29T05:29:33.757Z,3

Pizza Hut,"5393 Wesleyan Dr #111, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,Just moved into the area a month ago so this was my first time ordering from here. I ordered a meat lovers thin pizza. The crust was extremely chewy. I thought ok maybe it's just one piece. Tried another one same thing. So my husband flips it over and the bottom was soggy and you could tell from looking at the dough exactly why it tastes that way. It almost looks doughy. I wasn't gonna call but pizzas are not cheap. So I call up to store to let them know. I wasn't going back out again that night it's cold and I'm already home comfy. So anywho I call. I was told to bring the pizza back another day to get it replaced smh. So I'm supposed to bring a day old pizza back today or another day. Hilarious. But that pizza will be definitely dropped off there today since they want it back so bad.It definitely wasn't consumable. It was pretty but tasted horrible.Grocery store pizza tastes better than this did. I probably won't ever get thin crust from this location again if it tastes like that.,en,en,,,3.6,2023-12-01T13:12:09.932Z,52

This is my edit after 2 years. Same old treatment. Especially at night. The line moves as slow as molasses. Whoever cooks and manages at night (there is probably no manager at night, it shows. 10-15 minutes per car. As a person who doesn’t drink, come here if you need to sober up and bring a tent.

McDonald's (Bonney Rd),"4696 Bonney Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,4,"A Solid and Speedy Stop on Independence Blvd.
This particular McDonald's has become my reliable go-to for a quick and satisfying meal, especially when I'm on the move along the busy Independence corridor. The standout feature here is undoubtedly the efficiency of their drive-thru service. Even during what appears to be a chaotic lunch rush, the line moves along at a commendably brisk pace, and the staff manages to remain composed and friendly.
On my most recent visit, my order of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese and a side of their classic fries was delivered promptly and accurately. The burger was hot and fresh, and the fries had that perfect level of crispiness and salt. It’s this consistency that keeps me coming back; you know exactly what you're going to get, and it rarely disappoints. The convenience of its location is another major plus, making it an easy pit stop whether you're heading to the interstate or running errands in the area.
The reason for withholding that final star is the occasional inconsistency with the cleanliness of the dining area during peak times. While generally well-maintained, there have been a couple of instances where finding a completely clean table required a bit of a search. However, this is a minor critique of what is otherwise a very well-run and dependable McDonald's.

McDonald's (Bonney Rd),"4696 Bonney Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"It was the worst McDonald’s experience I’ve ever had. Granted, it’s McDonalds and the bar isn’t high to begin with. It was late, kids were hungry, we’re heading back to the hotel.

I ordered my food via the app (3 plain cheeseburger Happy Meals, 2 Big Mac meals - one with no cheese, one cheeseburger with ketchup and lettuce). I go to pick up the food, it’s not ready yet. 10 mins go by, still nothing. One kid is tired so I take them back to the Westin (1 min drive) and drop them off and come back. Still no food. It took 30+ minutes to get my order!

The order was still piecemealed together. Forgot the drinks, forgot a Happy Meal. Eventually we get everything and my son and I get it back to the hotel.

Nothing was was warm. Everything was cold like it’d been sitting. Both Big Macs were plain-ish: no lettuce, no pickle, no sauce, a little bit of onion and one slice of cheese.

The cheeseburgers with ketchup and lettuce (it’s extra) had no lettuce, but it had onions, mustard and pickles…

I get it, it’s McDonalds but this is a new low. The restaurant itself was clean, and the staff was friendly but so slow.",en,en,,,3.4,2025-04-22T03:09:21.166Z,8

McDonald's (Bonney Rd),"4696 Bonney Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"This was not a visit that I was expecting only because I usually do not dine in. A friend and I went in, and she got the Fish-fil-a large combo with sweet tea, and I got a Fish-fil-a sandwich only. She asked for no tarter sauce, and I asked for extra. I also asked them to make them fresh so I wouldn't have to wonder if they were fresh or not. We sat in the dining area for over 15 minutes, and a lady asked us if we had received our food yet. We both shook our heads and said no, and she was baffled to where our food was and why it was taking so long. Yes, it was lunch time, and the drive-thru was around the building, but inside was only us and 3 other people. She came back out 5 minutes later and apologized. My friend opened her fish, and hers had tarter, mustard, and mayo on it. Mine was to my liking. BUT, we came together and I was not going to eat in front of her and she had tea to drink only! So, the lady said that they would remake them both and it wouldn't take too long. She brought them out within 7 minutes, and her fries were not fresh. At this point, I had no patience for this, and I asked her, ""What is going on?"" She was the Mgr. and said that they had an influx of door dash and drive-thru orders that the cook was simply overloaded and offered us a blizzard. Well, my friend took one, but I can't have sugar, so I was fine. My issue is going inside to eat is not like when we were kids! They pay no attention to the customers, and they are understaffed at a time when they should have plenty of people to handle a lunch time!
Nevertheless, I will not be wasting my time in this establishment again. It's just not worth it! BTW, a combo for her was $17.29, and my total was, I believe, $6.14! WOW, I know it is expensive to eat out, but McDonalds has taken it to a whole other level of expensive! SMH 😕 😔",en,en,,,3.4,2025-04-14T14:12:22.306Z,151

Not only does the wait time for simple orders run into sit down dining territory but when you finally do get your food they’ve either screwed up the order, it’s been sitting and is cold, or they’ve done everything to rip you off even more…most times all three.

Always check your food before you leave because when they fill fries they don’t pop the container open all the way and only fill half of it.

Burger King (Princess Anne Rd),"5572 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Burger King: A Heartbreaking Decline in Quality**

I have watched the steady decline of Burger King's product quality over the past year and more, and my recent visit to the location at Comanche Road and Princess Anne Road  Virginia Beach has left me truly disheartened.

Once, their chicken breakfast sandwiches were generously sized, often rivaling the burgers themselves and extending to the edges of the buns, biscuits, or croissants. Now, what I received was nothing short of a ripoff: the chicken was alarmingly small—barely larger than a chicken nugget. For a price that keeps climbing, the portion sizes have shrunk drastically.

This is why businesses like Chick-fil-A continue to outshine and outpace Burger King. I feel taken advantage of, and as a result, I requested a refund. I will never patronize Burger King again. It’s time for Burger King to address this issue and return to the quality and portion sizes that loyal customers deserve.",en,en,,,3.5,2024-09-20T12:27:09.572Z,29

Sonic Drive-In,"4889 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,The younger lady with glasses that took our order on January 14th at 3:05pm has horrible customer service. I had the order 4 times and she kept asking for it over and over. It seemed like she was busy and not at the computer with an attempt to delay until she got to the computer. She was extremely rude when she was finally inputting the order because she read back the order 3 times and it was wrong. We only had a kids meal with slushie and a medium sluchie. Seems simple. When I went to pay she was on her phone with her AirPod in having a conversation and asked for the payment twice. I paid and never got a receipt for my order. My order wasn’t ready and she then said “you will pull ahead. Your chicken isn’t done” who hires or doesn’t quality check their employees???,en,en,,,3.5,2025-01-14T20:09:23.117Z,7

I had to repeat 4 different times a specific modification to my pork sandwich.  Service WAS STUPID SLOW.  I should have watched the drive-thru to see how service was done and where I was in the line or if the staff were handling drive-thru as top priority over those that were in the car stalls.  The other 2 Sandwiches were made accurately, but were kind of flatten, possibly sitting and waiting to go out...  the only redeeming aspect was the mozzarella cheesesticks!  Fresh and crunchy hot!!!
UPDATE:  The breakfast sandwiches and fries were hot and fresh!   Service was much better, since the last previous visit/this critique!  The only thing was the drinks...  We wanted LIGHT ice in our medium drinks.  When we finished our drinks, there was still more half a cup of ice...

It also looks like they removed a lot of bunkers which I'm not sure why. Could have used more challenges around the greens. Still a fun round. I played in a scramble so not sure about the cost.

Cypress Point Country Club,"5340 Club Head Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,5,My family has vacationed at Sandbridge for 36 years.  Always played a few rounds of golf at the nearby Hells Point course.  The last few years that course went downhill and prices doubled.  We decided to try other nearby courses.  Cypress Point CC is by far a better course.  Well maintained.  Actually has grass on the tee boxes and they regularly relocate the holes unlike Hells Point that I think the holes are still in the same as they were last year.  Fun course for half the price too.  If you are vacationing at Sandbridge or VA Beach I highly recommend Cypress Country Club,en,en,,,4.3,2025-08-26T19:48:47.554Z,89

Cypress Point Country Club,"5340 Club Head Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,4,"The course was in great shape and has a forgiving layout. Rough is cut a bit high and sometimes you can't see the ball until you stand right over it. Fairways are mostly soft so don't expect much rollout. It's a fairly short course so not that big a problem. I had no issue making greens in regulation even playing off their back tees. Greens are extremely slow and soft (plugged a wedge shot in the center of a green on #8). Speed is so slow; I would guess under 8 on a stimpmeter but they do roll true and are easy to read. All-in-all a decent experience. Course allowed me to score at my handicap my first time playing.
Pros
1. Great staff all around
2. Everything is green and well-manicured
3. Electric carts are in great shape (would be nice if they had GPS)
Cons
1. No sand in the sand jars (club employee stated they haven't had sand since covid)
2. Lots of ball marks left unrepaired on greens and footsteps not raked in traps
3. Driving range was closed before my tee time because the collector wasn't connected to the tractor to collect balls",en,en,,,4.3,2024-08-01T22:13:35.218Z,14

Fast-forward another 5 minutes and this girl named Taylor? brought out a bag, asked if we had ordered the items she had, and I told her yes and 3 drinks; she only had food so she said that she would go get them.

I think the pump was on back order (supply chain) My family and I have had a great time up there this summer and beyond.  I always hate seeing when people don’t have a good experience up there.  The pool is crystal clear and refreshing right now.  Keith has also helped my swing out w private lessons I’ve gotten from him.  Don’t give up on them!  Hope to see you around the club!

Sunrise Pizza Restaurant,"4848 Virginia Beach Blvd #1, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,4,"Sunrise Pizza is located along Virginia Beach Blvd. in the Aragona Village Shopping Center in Virginia Beach.  I had heard about the place through an ad on Facebook and decided to try them out sometime.  My visit here was on August 30, 2025.

I had gotten here around 3:45 pm, so parking wasn't an issue.  Since it is in a shopping center, parking tends to be available.  They are on the corner end of the shopping center.  The inside of the place is pretty simple.  There is seating available, as well as the pick-up and ordering counter for to-go orders.

My mom and I decided to dine in, and we could choose where to sit.  There wasn't anyone else visiting the place at the time.  Our server came over fairly quickly to get our drink orders and a menu to review.  For those that drink sodas, they carry Pepsi products.  After getting our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order, but we weren't just yet since there was quite a bit to choose from.  After some more time, she came back to us, and we were ready to order.  I ended up getting a Pepperoni Calzone.  My mom went with the Homemade Meatloaf Entree which was on special that day.

A few minutes later, she came back to bring the garden salad and garlic knots that are part of the homemade meatloaf entree.  I did get to try one of the garlic knots and it was really good.  After about 10 minutes or so, the main meals came to the table.  The Pepperoni Calzone looked great, as well as the Homemade Meatloaf entree.  They were both hot when they came out.  The Pepperoni Calzone was really good.  I only had half of it, as I didn't want to overload myself on carbs.  It did end up elevating my blood sugars afterwards, but not significantly higher.  My mom liked the Homemade Meatloaf entree too.

As a part of the coupon I had, I was able to get a free small pizza, which I ordered to-go.  It didn't include any toppings, but I did have pepperoni added to it.  I would have a few slices over a few days.  That pizza was good too.

Overall, this was a good experience here.  They have daily specials, as well as lunch specials if you come in during the lunch hours.  They did well to ensure we had what we wanted and if there were any issues (there were none).  If you are in this part of the city and looking for a pizza type of place, this place is worth checking out.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-11-08T20:23:40.436Z,192

They’ve got plenty of parking (no stress there!), a convenient location right in the heart of Virginia Beach, and a wide variety of food to choose from. Everything is always fresh — and all halal, which is really important for our family.

Whether you’re stopping by for a quick lunch or sitting down for a cozy family dinner, this spot is a total win. Highly recommended! 🙌",en,en,,,4.1,2025-11-07T20:59:08.961Z,4

I ordered the meat loaf and chicken gyro to try out this place for the first time.
I was super disappointed in the meat loaf, it was kinda dry. They do give you two decent pieces but it had no flavoring and didn’t taste great.
Now I know this is a pizza place, and you can’t super mad that a meatloaf doesn’t taste great at a pizza place.
With that being said, the mashed potatoes, and gyro was very good. The fries would’ve been really good if they were cooked a little more. The customer service was great.

I ordered through Postmates and apparently they don’t have the full app, because according to the app, my order is still being worked on. I was offered a $10 coupon that I have to use in the restaurant. Yet my order on Postmates was way more expensive. They should NOT be on the delivery app, if they can’t utilize it correctly. So I didn’t have the option to leave a review, make a complaint or adjust the tip. So that I could have had the option of ordering from a different restaurant. I definitely feel taken advantage of. Money is tight enough already and to offer me a $10 coupon which of course means I would have to order from them again is unacceptable. They can keep the coupon.

Boulevard Stop Mart - Krispy Krunchy Chicken,"5444 Virginia Beach Blvd # 101, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I was a frequent goer there because I loved the chicken and wedge combo. On a Tuesday close to their closing time, I went because I had a craving for their food. The cook asked me to talk to the cashier for my order. I asked for a breast and wedge order. The cook yelled, “Does it look like there’s breasts here?” but in a very rude and disrespectful manner. I went back and checked him letting him know that it was a mistake not realizing there wasn’t any there, but he needed to watch his tone. He preceded to ignore what I was saying, being obnoxious about it. The cashier was very gracious, asking me what I wanted, but I decided to get my money back because customer service like that cook gave should not be rewarded under any circumstance. I will always like the brand, but I won’t frequent this branch again because there was no reason for him to be so snarky like he was.

People need to keep in mind that if a place is going to be great, especially one that sells food, the cook has to be cordial to its customers as well or else they will lose business. The food will always be great, but that service was beyond unacceptable.",en,en,,,4.3,2023-07-26T16:47:37.777Z,9

Pho 79,"4816 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I’ve been eating at Pho79 on Va. Beach Blvd for 20 years because their food has always been good. Atmosphere is just okay but that is not important here in this review. “The service” last night was rude and awful. My friend and I walked in at 7:29pm, hours on door says open to 8pm. The closing manager came over and knows I’m a regular and said “Do you know we close at 8pm?” He was clearly agitated that we were there. I said yes,  I’m aware and that is why we came at 7:30pm. We ordered without looking at the menu immediately. He never asked how we were, no smile just plainly agitated that we came. There were 6 other occupied tables when we arrived.
At 7:55pm all tables had left except for us and one other table of 2.  We were only half finished with our small bowls of soup.  We were rushing the whole time, their soup is always hot and even though the soup tasted amazing we wanted to leave from there, due to feeling like the manager did not want us.  So, at 7:55pm paid $31 for 2 small bowls of soup and asked for soup containers to take home the leftovers. I wrapped the sprouts and basil in napkins, no box was given for that and we left.
So here is My Suggestion, Pho lock your doors at 7pm or 7:30pm, so No new customers can enter. This way the closing manager and staff can leave by 8pm. Keep the inside door handle unlocked so inside guests can leave. If you keep offending your regulars or any customers they will stop coming. One more incident, the busser who was cleaning tables bumped the heavy cart on wheels so hard into my booth seat, that my whole seat moved out of place with me in it. Never said sorry, never asked if I was okay?
I’m a former server and both behaviors are offensive and unacceptable.  Obviously customers at this location are not valued. Just Lock your doors at 7p or 7:30p to keep your customers from coming into eat, so you can go home exactly at 8pm. We sat in the car and watched the last table leave at 8p and the closing manager walked out a few minutes after that.",en,en,,,3.8,2025-07-21T11:59:25.456Z,35

Save your coins and go to another location or just another establishment. We don’t go to Waffle House cause it’s 5 star service but if I order a waffle, bring me a waffle not a completely different item.

Good customer service is never an issue there.

Boulevard Stop Mart - Krispy Krunchy Chicken,"5444 Virginia Beach Blvd # 101, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,I try not to be overly positive about these places. Because for one it's a corner store.  It's not exactly the best store but the chicken is absolutely the best in town we've had so far. For a quick hot fairly inexpensive box of fried chicken potato wedges and either a honey or blueberry biscuit. You can't go wrong with Krispy Krunchy Chicken. It's in the name. It's both crispy and crunchy. Like others have said the chicken is seasoned all the way to the bone. Not spicy just flavor packed. You should definitely check them out for the chicken if nothing else.,en,en,,,4.3,2022-03-29T13:07:18.609Z,79

Waffle House,"5397 Wesleyan Dr, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"Sorry excuse for a GOOD chain. Both cook, and waitress were both face deep in telephones for several minutes upon me and my wife walking in. Only for the waitress to still clutch onto her phone and basically have us raise our voice to order our food. My wife orders hers, no problem, then I start to tell her I'd like a t bone steak medium well, only for her phone to chime off, and her ignore what I was saying, just to check the phone and be oblivious to anything else going on. I stopped talking, and waited for her to finish, then she said that I could tell her what I'd like to eat, and at that point I'm getting frustrated, and said yeah I know and I did that, but the phone in your hand is way more important than that of the other people in this restaurant, and your job at that. My wife stepped in and said we we're gonna just go elsewhere. Pretty sad when you can't even go to a restaurant without this nonsense going on. Very displeased, and will never step foot in that location again. I'll make sure to tell everyone I do business to avoid this place due to a waste of time and lack of respect.

(I was eating them before I saw the legs) I usually get them at the one on Volvo but this was closer today. It seems none of the locations are consistent with item preparation.

Pho 79,"4816 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"The place was not very welcoming. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted, but the son of whomever worked there (must've been in his 20s but clearly had a mental disability so I don't fault him in particular)  started yelling out loud and touching my missing arm as I was trying to order. Not a single worker intervened or apologized or anything. I then decided to just brush it off as it is definitely the people around him that have failed him.

Now on to the ordering process. I originally asked for 2 small #4 bowls with spring rolls. The man up front told me that they did not have any smalls (I looked at pictures of the menu, and it had them there, but I was not gonna press the issue), I reluctantly asked for larges instead until I found out it was going to be $50.

Mind you, I am an optimist, so I am still fine with the strangness, and I opt to just get 1 large.

Now, the weirdest thing happened while I was sitting down. First, though, I wanna say I am not making any accusations or assumptions, just mearly going to write down what I saw. An older caucasian gentleman walked in with a young vietnamese girl. He then started yelling for the older lady in the back, asking where she was. A different man walked out from the back and told him to shush while waving him over. They then spoke quietly amongst themselves while seemingly aware I was watching, and then the old lady came out as well. The caucasian man saw her and said, ""Here you go! She is all yours now!"" and walked out.

I will reiterate that I am not making any assumptions and only typing what I witnessed.

Finally, the food. The broth was a lot more ""gingery"" than I am used to with pho, and the beansprouts had a funky smell. The only saving grace was the fresh spring rolls, which is why I gave them 2 stars for food but 1 star for everything else.

Safe to say, I will never be coming back. It even prompted me to write a review, which I almost never do.",en,en,,,3.8,2024-03-23T00:37:55.650Z,1

He asked me twice how did I want my steak I said medium please he said medium rare I said no medium he said medium well I looked at him and I said no medium please. I ended up getting a well done steak. Which was dry and taste like rubber. I also asked for onions on my hash browns and it was so little that it wasn't even worth getting.the only thing that was cooked correctly was the toast. I ended up taking the steak home and fed it to my dog. Wanted to treat myself instead of eating at work that day being that I work seven days a week I wasn't in the mood to eat in my job. (Ihop) also the employees stared at me like I was crazy because I was in my work uniform. When I went to pay I asked for a to-go box and I tried to give my server my card.

At 4:00 we get a call from a driver saying he can't find the place, but he coukd hardly speak English, so we could not tell him how to get there. We texted him the address again and called the store. We were told by the manager that they would put some pizzas in and drive them over themselves. At 4:20 I called back because we were 10 minutes from having to send 15 kids home hungry. I was told that they don't have any drivers and had to send it with their ""partner"" grubhub. If I wanted to count on a gig worker, I would have ordered from grubhub. At 4:30 the original guy l finally found it with our original pizzas that he was driving around with for 40 minutes. Luckily, the venue allowed us to extend our stay there so the kids finally got fed, but we missed half of our daughters party dealing with this mess.

Marco's Pizza,"5649 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,3,"Update:4/19/24 - I just decided to give another try to this business. Disappointed again.. I ordered what they call the Pizzoli, which is not on the website. I ordered the buffalo chicken with light sauce simialr to pizza roll or wrap. I received a roll filled with cheese, no buffalo sauce and what appears to be three small stripes of chicken with a little cup of ranch I did ask for. The whole roll was roughly less than 5 inches for $7+ dollars... There will not be a third time!!! SEE photos.

Initial post:
Well, this is a new location..... Now I would have given them 4 stars for cleanliness, for not letting the cook do the register or folding boxes or doing anything else without thoroughly washing hands up to the elbow. Great!!!  This was a good thing! Now the food on the other hand. I just ordered the Pizza bowl and wings. The Wings 4 Stars. The bowl was supposed to be a two-serving bowl based on the writing on the menu. Well to my surprise, it was not and only enough to cover the bottom of the plastic black bowl and not even half full.  This should have been double the contents if was to be a two-serving bowl for the price as advertised. I am nearly done with just three quick scoops, so glad I ordered wings I would have been still hungry. This was and is only enough for one serving or person. Even if they had put another $1 on the price and added more toppings to be two-servings.  That would have been perfect.",en,en,,,4,2024-04-18T20:51:11.196Z,29

I think they were still making it.  Then today, I ordered the food on the Marco app around 1pm to pick up at 5:35pm. During this time I again received emails they started my order right away & it was ready at 1:30pm. Again, hoping that was not the case. Husband goes to pick it up at 5:35pm & it can’t be located.  They can’t find a record on my name or the order. I even texted the email confirmations for my husband to show the guy.  Evidently order was never made, who really knows. So they had to remake the entire order (2 pizza bowls, 2 pizzas & cheese bread).  Who has time to wait - that’s why I ordered online in advance.  Order should have been ready 20 mins ago.  The food is good, but the service is terrible.  We gave them 3 chances.  We will not go to this location again.",en,en,,,4,2024-02-11T23:01:07.255Z,5

We ordered last night because my kids wanted to try Marco's but we won't make that mistake again. My order was placed at 5:40, and pizza tracker said it was baking soon after. At 7:40 I called the restaurant to inquire since it had been 2 hours. I was told that they only had 1 driver, he was out and that my order would be delivered next. Our pizza showed up after more than an hour obviously cold and disgusting at 8:45. Over 3 hours for pizza?!? Customer service was non existent and management should learn how to schedule or atleast stop taking orders if you can't deliver them.

Pho 79,"4816 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Đánh Giá về Quán Phở 79: Một Trải Nghiệm Đáng Quên

Khi lựa chọn một địa điểm để thưởng thức phở vào cuối tuần, gia đình tôi đã quyết định ghé qua Phở 79 với hy vọng tìm thấy không chỉ những bát phở ngon mà còn là sự đón tiếp nồng hậu, thân thiện. Tuy nhiên, trải nghiệm của chúng tôi không như mong đợi.

Từ khi bước chân vào quán, chúng tôi đã cảm nhận được không khí lạnh lẽo, thiếu sự chào đón. Thái độ của nhân viên phục vụ thậm chí còn tệ hơn: không có lời chào hỏi, không có sự quan tâm tối thiểu mà bạn mong đợi từ một nhà hàng. Chỉ với một cử chỉ, họ đã báo hiệu chúng tôi ngồi xuống mà không hề có bất kỳ sự ấm áp hay mời gọi nào.

Khi nhận menu, không có sự giới thiệu hay hỏi han về đồ uống hay món ăn mà chúng tôi muốn thử. Mọi thứ diễn ra một cách máy móc, khiến chúng tôi cảm thấy như mình không được chào đón tại đây.

Tôi đã từng thăm rất nhiều quán phở khắp nơi và luôn coi trọng sự lịch sự, thân thiện từ nhân viên. Điều này không chỉ giúp thức ăn trở nên ngon miệng hơn mà còn khiến trải nghiệm ăn uống trở nên đáng nhớ. Thật đáng tiếc, Phở 79 đã không làm được điều đó.

Trải nghiệm tại Phở 79 đã để lại một ấn tượng không mấy tích cực trong lòng chúng tôi. Đó không chỉ là sự thất vọng về cách phục vụ, mà còn là cảm giác không được trân trọng như những vị khách nên được đối xử. Hy vọng rằng, quán sẽ nhận ra và cải thiện mức độ dịch vụ của mình để không ai phải trải qua những cảm xúc tương tự.

Bài đánh giá này dựa trên trải nghiệm cá nhân và cảm nhận của bạn, nêu rõ những vấn đề bạn gặp phải khi ăn tại quán. Hy vọng nó sẽ giúp chủ quán nhận thức và cải thiện dịch vụ của mình trong tương lai.",en,vi,"Review of Pho 79 Restaurant: An Unforgettable Experience

When choosing a place to enjoy pho on the weekend, my family decided to stop by Pho 79 with the hope of finding not only delicious bowls of pho but also a warm, friendly welcome. However, our experience was not as expected.

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we felt the cold, unwelcoming atmosphere. The attitude of the waiters was even worse: no greetings, no minimal attention that you would expect from a restaurant. With just a gesture, they signaled us to sit down without any warmth or invitation.

When receiving the menu, there was no introduction or inquiry about the drinks or dishes that we wanted to try. Everything happened mechanically, making us feel like we were not welcome here.

I have visited many pho restaurants around the world and always appreciate politeness and friendliness from the staff. This not only makes the food more delicious but also makes the dining experience more memorable. Unfortunately, Pho 79 did not do that.

The experience at Pho 79 left us with a not-so-positive impression. It was not only the disappointment in the service, but also the feeling of not being appreciated as the guests should be treated. Hopefully, the restaurant will realize and improve its service level so that no one else has to go through the same feelings.

This review is based on your personal experience and feelings, highlighting the problems you encountered when eating at the restaurant. Hopefully, it will help the restaurant owner to be aware and improve their service in the future.",en,3.8,2024-02-25T15:32:50.360Z,5

The reason I gave a four on service is because they do not speak any English, and if you don't repeat the number pertinent to the dish, you might have some language barrier in placing your order.

We were seated and then asked what we would like. They had to come back because we didn't really have a chance to look over the menu. They didn't come back for another 15 minutes so I felt we were a bit forgotten. I ordered the chicken pho which is one of the favorites on the menu. But I have to agree with it being my favorite, it was really good. It tasted like chicken noodle soup but a pho take on it. It came out pretty quick after ordering. All the utensils are on the tables already. The soup spoons do not look clean. I used my nail and noticed residue came off. All the spoons were like that. After we ordered our food, no one ever came to check in on us. Since no one ever came to check on us, I wasn't able to ask for a plastic spoon. When you are done you pay at the counter.

I recommend taking your business to Jets, they are fast and you won't have to wait or waste time with careless staff.",en,en,,,4,2023-09-23T14:36:56.212Z,2

After another 30 minutes, we called again and the guy told us the pizza had just gone out the door (so evidently lied the first time). Last call was to cancel the order. Also, disrespectful phone service. No sympathy for the wait and treated almost as if we need to be more understanding that there's only one delivery driver (on a Saturday night).

I asked for light seasoning on my fries and got over salted fries and about only half  of the portion size in my combo. Even asked for light salt on my cheese fries and they were so salty we couldn’t even eat them. The boneless wings were over cooked and under sauced with no flavor and the bone in wings were not much better either. Soggy and under sauced. Carrots were water logged and stringy. $40 dollars down the drain. Probably won’t return to this location again or Wingstop for a while 😩🤧😮‍💨,en,en,,,3.4,2025-12-06T00:08:56.095Z,7

it was clearly leaking from the kitchen, and it was honestly disgusting. While we were eating, we noticed employees licking their fingers like they were snacking on wings behind the counter. It was incredibly unhygienic and unprofessional.

The tables and chairs were sticky, and it felt like nothing had been cleaned properly. The fries tasted old and reheated, and to make matters worse, the roll of napkins placed next to the soda machine was soaked from the kitchen leak.

Made back to my hotel at see that they didn’t give me either of the 3 piece tender combos i ordered. I called to get a refund because i am not driving back on my vacation. The worker was rude on the phone from the get go. She asked if i want a refund of what. I said that would be great thanks. And then she hung up on me. I called back 3 times until a new lady answered she told me the phone died and i had a remake written in the book in the back. Whatever that is. I told her i wasn’t coming all the way back.

That same day we went for breakfast AND lunch and coffee! Since then, we've been back to VA beach 2x and make a point to stop there every time! They do not disappoint! Amazing food, huge portions of food, and delicious and quality coffee. This last time when I was there, a man accidentally spilled his coffee on his car through the drive thru and then began to cuss out the employees saying they didn't put the lid on right.. anyway, the employees handled him with gentleness and kindness the entire time. It is sad when someone cares more about their car vs. how they treat people. I will of course be praying for this man. ANYWAY, we will ALWAYS come back to Town Center Cold Pressed any chance we get!

If I can get up there to pick up the order I’m basically doing their job for them! Letting them know what they missed and how to make the order! When I call to let them know what I’m missing I believe the same girl (same timeframes, same voice but a different name) says that the delivery drivers steal the food. Not sure how because the bags are always properly sealed. I guess the drivers have their own Wingstop bags and stickers to reseal the bag. And what’s up with the fries! If I don’t want the original “Wingstop Fry seasoning“ why do I still taste sugar! From missing chicken wings, dips, and drinks. I’ve lost at minimum of $80 with them in the last year;I love my ranch!) we’re not going to talk about what I lost before then!

I called back again and the girl kept putting me on hold after I told her what online says. She kept saying that I have to cancel it. I was then put on hold and she never came back to the phone. I called the store and they wouldn’t answer. They are rude and I never got my money back. I reached out to customer service and they didn’t get back to me like they said they would in 72 hours.

When I mentioned my order wasn't complete I received attitude followed by an eye roll and she snatched my receipt to check it. After she realized her mistake she continued with the attitude like I had done something wrong. By the time I received the other half of my order the first half was room temperature and no longer hot. It was a waste of over 100 bucks that I'll never get back.

It is very important to note that this is NOT authentic Vietnamese coffee, it’s cold brew with syrup and I was not a fan at all. I also ordered a bagel that was $7, pretty pricey. The second time I go back to give them a second chance and get a juice. I see the Ginger Lemonades on the menu and order one with the barista, NOPE all out. I had asked about the lemonades the first time I was in and they were out at that time too! Then I asked about the Pressed juices and she said the only juice they have is what’s in the grab and go fridge which was only 4 options and the little immunity shots. Why have a large menu if you are only going to carry 1/4 of the juice options. Also what do you mean that’s all you carry when there are photos of juices in plastic cups?

Each selection charges extra and then I didn't even get what I ordered extra in my drink. Customer service was non existent.,en,en,,,4.5,2025-05-04T20:16:39.602Z,7

Wingstop,"928 Diamond Springs Rd Ste 105, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"We Love the wings but the service has made us not want to return. We have been twice since the beginning of January to get wings for football games.

The service at the pickup counter was absolutely horrible. We went on the night on the 1st and 10th of the month. The lack of attentiveness, and blatant rudeness. Was unacceptable. As a former industry worker, and manager, I was appalled at the treatment myself and other customers around us received for simply picking up orders. We waited close to 10min without a single employee acknowledging us and when trying to speak we were told ""hold on, we're busy"" while they went back to talking amongst themselves.

The FOH needs a lot more training on how to greet customers at the door, simply acknowledging guests when they walk in, asking them what they need and being kind.

We will be finding another wing place for future events and family dinners.",en,en,,,3.4,2025-01-12T17:43:16.738Z,1

Every time I call the store, he's not available nor returns my calls. He originally stated he would resolve it within 72 hours after forwarding it to the regional manager. I have escalated it to corporate and am waiting for their follow-up. Let's see how fast they move. Run from this establishment. Please believe the reviews; I should have. It's been 9 days without resolution so that should tell you how they feel about their customers!!!

They should educate employees on how to handle food for the public, because it's not the same as when you do it at home.

The cashier did not acknowledge me at all, no response to my greeting or thank you and no letting me know what my total was. She never said a word to me. I give people grace so I thought maybe she was having a bad day.

The rest of the visit felt like it was a more widespread issue in the store.  The person behind the sandwich area forgot my side.  When I mentioned that I had an add on, there was an attitude.  When I went to pick up my drink, there were 2 people making them that had no sense of urgency whatsoever.  It took me almost 20 minutes to get my drink.

They don't tell you about the specials other customers tell you. I asked for a drink, and I was never told they did not sell that drink but they rang me up for a drink, knowing they didn't sell what I asked for. I believe one of the staff was being trained, but until they know how to do everything, they should not be taking orders alone.",en,en,,,3.4,2023-10-29T05:41:23.184Z,346
Wingstop,"928 Diamond Springs Rd Ste 105, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"I went in there and placed an order. I got a 10 piece with fries, chicken tenders and fries and the cajun meal. I ordered 2 large drinks and 1 medium. The dude name que sd i ordered 5 drinks. I told him i only need 3 drinks...2nd time im telling him 2 large drinks and 1 medium. I got my order almost and hour later. When i got my order the girl gave me my drinks. I said i ordered 2 large drinks and 1 medium. She saud thats not what your receipt says. I said thats what ordered. She got the other girl involved and was ready to give it to me. She went and got the guy named que...he sd you never ordered 2 large and 1 medium drink. He argued with me about it. Showed the screeb but i never got my receipt or asked if i wanted it. The guy que was hardly in the store. He barely helped out the girls. There was like 5 orders. They were extremely slow. Another person was checking her order and they got her order wrong, too. When i got home with my order the fries on all the orders were cold. Barely edible. The wings were decent. I work at a restaurant and we have to cover our hair to avoid getting hair in the food. The stafff had no hairnets, hats or nothing on to protect the food. Which is a health department violation. Which i think i might call them about issue. My daughter was sick as a dog the next day. She has no food allergies.

Update, i received a message from local store aplogizing. However. They gave me $5e gift card when i spent over $40. How does that does that help? You cant buy anything for $5 there.

Update: corp posted something on there facebook page. I told them how is $5 gonna do something when i spent almost $40 at the store. They wanted to see how much i spent. I screenshotted a copy from my bank statement since store refused to give me receipt. Corp ended up giving me a $40 gift card.
Im ordering again tonight lets see how it goes. Ill be posting another review.",en,en,,,3.4,2023-10-25T23:40:20.665Z,9

Wawa,"701 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"Man, I start my day at 4am went to Wawa to get $175 in gas and some coffee with my team. It’s 4:46am the lady doing the coffee overhears me telling my brother about a deal. Coffee, sizzli, and a hash brown for $5. She tells us “they don’t  start making them till 5am”. I asked if she could heat me up one real quick she replied “we don’t start making them till 5am” (in my head I’m like what’s the difference if I use the kiosk to have one made?) i said ok I’ll wait.

My team goes to The register to pay for what they’re purchasing. The lady behind the register overheard us and replied what were you asking for sir? I told her and her response was the same. I told her I would wait because I’m waiting on someone to arrive so I can gas them up. At 4:56am the lady behind the register walks to the back and comes back out and asks what kind of sandwich I’d like. They were out of turkey so I replied the sausage bagel and added “I get a hash brown too right?” The lady doing the coffee responded no hash browns rn they take 15min. At that point I decided to pay for my coffee and leave.

This is why I dont like coming to this wawa. Terrible service. At other Wawas they would have made one for me. There was 2 other people in the store.  It wasn’t busy at all.",en,en,,,3,2025-04-15T11:11:43.044Z,8

The coffee is consistently good and the vibe is very warm and cozy.

The only thing I think could improve the experience is getting rid of the touch kiosks. It is fairly easy to use, and while I understand the need for them for busy periods, it lacks the personal touch. I love ordering with a real person and often am able to use my rewards points easier.

I think Cold Pressed has improved dramatically and leadership is taking steps to make the store a hub for community connection and I think that’s beautiful.

Wingstop,"928 Diamond Springs Rd Ste 105, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,4,"I haven't eaten from a Wing Stop location in years due to a bad experience, but I decided to give it a try. I went inside the restaurant to order and was greeted by the most polite staff member. He was very friendly and kindly took my order. Great experience so far! I ordered the mild wings with fries and a drink. Unfortunately, I went home to eat the food and was very disappointed with the wings. It literally tasted like oil, water, and very little sauce. The ranch was the only reason I was able to eat the chicken, in addition to my own hot sauce. I reached out to the company through the website to share my experience and they were amazing! I received a gift card from them and decided to try again but a different flavor. So I went in and had the same good customer service experience and picked up the order of classic Cajun wings and Cajun fries with cheese and ranch sauce. This time, I was very impressed with the food!! It was fresh, cooked just right, and the flavor was most certainly poppin! I loved how it had a lil spice to it as well! I'm grateful that the company responded well and provided me with the gift card to give it another try! But I most certainly hope they improve that mild sauce so that others don't have the same experience! The fries were always good though!!",en,en,,,3.4,2023-10-12T04:29:50.989Z,178

Wingstop,"928 Diamond Springs Rd Ste 105, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"My mother and I went in yesterday to order and I think that was our first mistake. Everyone that came is was picking up an order and didn't order drinks. I don't think anyone ever does just based on how disgusting the drink machine was. There is mold literally caked on the bottom draining area and all around the center ice machine and black flakes in the ice. The floor was slippery in the dining area as if they either never cleaned it before or used a dirty mop bucket from the kitchen grease.
The biggest issue to me was we asked the girl at the register if the mild sauce had dairy because I'm breast feeding and the baby has a severe allergy to dairy (which I disclosed to her) and she gave me a crazy look and said ""no, of course not. I have a dairy allergy too so trust me"". While waiting, it didn't sit right with me so I pulled up the nutritional facts on their website and sure enough, mild sauce does have dairy. I had to hurry and change the order.
This is already 2 lawsuits in the making on their part and I will be contacting the health department about it. Working in the food industry and seeing THAT much mold made me sick and I'm sure has actually made several people sick.
Steer clear of this place guys. Seriously.

El Rodeo Mexican Restaurant,"5834 E Virginia Beach Blvd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,2,"Good enough Mexican food, but not for anyone who cares about value. I’m a native Texan—not a professional critic, but I’ve eaten at enough good Mexican spots to know the difference.

Staff were kind, though a bit disengaged. Portions were generous, but the food itself was a 5/10 at best—more reminiscent of what I’ve had at a small town in the middle of Germany (not joking) than what I’d expect here. Just sayin'. At these prices, I expected more heart and passion in the cooking.

I left full, but not impressed. The food solved my hunger pains, but not much more. What really stung was the mismatch between price and plate—it left me questioning how Google ratings get so inflated.

If you’re fine paying above-average prices for average beans, rice, ground beef, and cheese, this place will work. But if you’re chasing the kind of Mexican food that justifies its cost, you’ll want to keep looking.

That's unfortunate...I was really eager to get some good Mexican food too.

Reply to response:

Thank you for your response—it’s clear you care about reviews. I respect that your restaurant has been around for 35 years; that shows loyalty and hard work. My feedback isn’t about wanting something free. It’s about balance: the prices charged versus the passion and care on the plate.

Right now, the food feels standard—beans, rice, beef, cheese—while the prices sit in the “premium” range. If the cost were lower, I’d call it fair. At this price point, I expected more heart and bold flavor.

Something has to give: either elevate the quality to match the price, or lower the cost to match the quality. Not doing so risks losing ground to other options nearby. Your reputation was built on higher standards than what I tasted, and I’d like to see that legacy shine again.

This isn’t a complaint, it’s honest feedback. With more care in the kitchen, your food could truly justify its cost and reflect the quality your history deserves.",en,en,,,4.5,2025-08-28T22:52:13.141Z,9

Captain D's,"6667 E Virginia Beach Blvd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I’m an Uber Eats delivery driver. Went to pick up and order and was under the impression order was accurate and filled. Got to the person to whom I was delivering to (IE the original customer) and discovered only 2 of the 3 meals were within the bag given.

I would have easily gone back to the store to simply picked up any remaining food I may have missed, and would not have had any issues driving back to it…had the girl who picked up the phone not hung up on me. Twice.

The second I introduced myself as the driver delivering from Uber Eats, the phone audibly is heard clicking; the line went dead.

Second time I call, they are in mid laughter from what I assume may have been about something else at work (yet is still not professional to hear on the line) and I try to reintroduce myself again. Full name and as ‘the driver from Uber Eats’.

Hung up again.

I don’t appreciate given the feeling of mockery while you can’t even act professional long enough to meet me halfway on a simple error. I don’t understand what I did wrong to deserve being made fun of on the phone. You not only mocked me for calling but the customer who now can’t even have a completed delivery.

This was at around 6pm today, October 5th, 2024.

Edit: Considering neither corporate nor the management ever replied to me when I was asked to send this to their website I will assume either they will not do anything about the issue with their workers or refuse to. My review and grade will remain as such.",en,en,,,3.6,2024-11-07T03:13:04.544Z,8

Not only did the waiters seemingly add their own prices to the ticket, which were way higher than I expected, but the food itself was just okay. For the price, I'd expect more.

Wawa,"701 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,This is my neighborhood wawa and the way the employees treat the customers is atrocious. You cannot ask the employees anything without an attitude and rude comments or completely ignoring you as a Customer. I have never had an issue with a wawa. But this location is a disservice to the people it services with in my community. I cannot wait to move so that I can have a better everyday experience at wawa,en,en,,,3,2024-01-10T11:30:14.869Z,41

Wawa,"701 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I’ve never had a bad thing to say about a Wawa store until this one. I’ve eaten here multiple times, and more have been bad than good. They’ve only ever got one person in the kitchen at a time even when there’s multiple people standing there waiting for orders, and the one that is there moves with no sense of urgency. Last time I got a hoagie there, after only five minutes it was already soggy and had paper sticking to the bun. This time, I order a shortie on the app before getting there since they always seem slow. From the time I ordered it to the time I gave up and left, 20 minutes had passed. There were only two people waiting for food, me and someone else, so it’s not like they were swamped.",en,en,,,3,2023-11-23T00:37:08.944Z,2

If I could give zero stars I would . I ordered an apple juice , orange Fanta , a whole sub with chicken provolone bacon and tomato sauce. I also got a bacon egg cheese and salsa burrito with sour cream. This is what I received my apple juice my sub with only chicken bacon actual tomatoes no sauce and Parmesan powdered cheese not provolone. I also got a coke not Fanta . My bacon in my burrito made me sick it was raw!!!! You can see the bacon from the wrap and the Parmesan cheese on the sub.

California Pizza Kitchen,"200 Central Park Ave, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"On November 29, 2025, my family (party of 11) experienced discriminatory and extremely unprofessional treatment at this California Pizza Kitchen location. From the moment we arrived, the service we received was noticeably different from what was being provided to other guests.

We were told the wait would be 30 minutes, which we respected. After the full wait, we were informed that our table was being delayed because a party who had already paid was “lingering.” When I asked to be seated at a table for 10 instead, the host refused until we said we would leave, and suddenly we were seated immediately.

Once at the table, our server became rude and dismissive toward my aunt after hearing her speak with a Spanish accent. Requests for basic items like bread and drinks were ignored or significantly delayed (bread didn’t come until after our food arrived). When we asked for a manager, we received a generic apology with no real effort to address the issue.

To make matters worse, the manager then assigned us a new server who approached the table speaking only Spanish despite the fact that I did not speak Spanish to the manager, I do not have a Spanish accent, and nearly half of our table does not speak Spanish. This confirmed that we were being judged based on our appearance and perceived ethnicity.

Cultural disrespect and discriminatory assumptions have no place in customer service or anywhere. Our evening was overshadowed by bias and unprofessionalism, and we left feeling unwelcome. I hope this management team takes this seriously and provides proper training for their staff.",en,en,,,4.2,2025-12-01T14:37:49.388Z,5

Captain D's,"6667 E Virginia Beach Blvd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"Went inside tried to order food using my Captain D’s e-giftcard I got as a gift through email. Cashier asks “Manager” named Tamika/Mika about it and she yells from the back kitchen saying they don’t accept digital giftcards. She then says she never heard of a e-giftcard and laughs at me. She off the bat came off aggressive and rude. I tried to explain it’s a digital giftcard sent by the company from the offical website. On the website they have options for digital e-giftcard through email. Clearly she is not EDUCATED or in fit position to be a “manager”. She did not come to the front to even look at it…nor did she even try to scan the giftcard code. The entire time she proceeds to yell at me from the back of the kitchen in a very aggressive manner for asking her to try redeeming it.
I have her on video recording of her yelling at me, then proceeding to call me Karen for asking several times why I can’t use my giftcard at the franchise. She threatened to call police on me for it too.  3 customers commented to me that it was ridiculous I couldn’t use my giftcard too.
Absolute NO customer service at all. You guys need a new and BETTER positive “manager”.

Had she listened to me instead of rushing me off of the phone she would not have MESSED the order up! Which I don’t think it would have made a difference!

This is all of their first time here and we bragged about how incredible our service and the steak bites were for months only to be left looking silly. My food was already delivered and mostly ate before my soda came; I had to go get it off the server’s tray after watching her in full on conversation. My teammates food was so cold it felt like it came straight from the walk-in. After the server got my husband and teammates drinks then walked away without even acknowledging me for a 2nd time I cashed out our tab and decided to just order from the bar. That was an even worse decision; after one of my players asked me to get their team shots since they gave up on their server ever showing up I got to stand with another gentleman waiting while we watched 3 employees behind bar eating and just looking at us. Finally, we get service and it took several trips bc our bartender couldn’t carry more than two glasses; if your bartender can’t do a 3 cup carry they need to be on the floor with a tray.

The staff is great and the atmosphere is always quite pleasant. If you're looking for a loud, obnoxious bar scene with a pool table or 2 that are crammed into a place thats too small to move around the tables then I'm sorry to inform you that this is NOT it. However, if you ARE looking for a place with plenty of room to move, decent and non-offensive music being played loud enough to be heard but not so loud that you cannot carry on a conversation, clean bathrooms, meticulously maintained tables and equipment and a staff that is as respectful and professional as possible then you've definitely found it. The only things required are that you operate with the same level of respect towards them as they give to you, respect the equipment and other patrons around you.

Todas sus recomendaciones fueron exquisitas. Las pizzas fueron exquisitas. Me recomendó un sampler de sangría que fue espectacular y el sabor que él me recomendó de verdad fue el mejor. Pero el final fue lo mejor. Me recomendó un postre butter cake con helado eso fue un súper deleite , mi esposa embarazada y la bebé que viene en camino lo disfrutaron mucho ( literal la bebé no deja de moverse en la panza) . Si quieren una buena experiencia pregunten por Jonathan mil gracias.",en,es,"It's been a long time since I've had a delicious meal, and I felt so well looked after.

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,2,"Went here Sunday after church around 12:30 pm. No wait time and the restaurant was not busy at all. I came here hoping my experience would be better than the last, but that was not the case at all. I ordered from their apparent “new” brunch menu and was excited because the options all sounded delicious. My excitement quickly went away from the wait time for our food, which was ridiculous (0/10) especially when the restaurant wasn’t busy at all. There was also inconsistency among the presentation of food on each plate brought to the table.

I first asked for a mock tail, the Burner (8/10) it was refreshing and I wanted to enjoy it, but the drinks were brought out so quick and our food took 35-40 minutes… For food, I asked for their Loaded brioche French toast (3/10), the menu stated “sweet cream filling” as if the French toast would be stuffed with the cream inside; however, what I was given was thick slices of dry bread, overly smothered in strawberries, with the tiniest amount of cream thrown on top! No “filling” in the bread, at all. Bacon (8/10), Grits (9/10), Scrambled Eggs with cheese (4/10) very bland, and Potatoes (2/10) basic, bland, and unseasoned. Additionally, I found out after an order needed to be redone at my table, that my potatoes were actually supposed to come with seasoning and peppers.

My soror who came to brunch with me, had to give her food back after the long wait since her order was not correct at all. What followed, was the manager coming to our table, with what seemed like a bit of an attitude, trying to find out how exactly the order was wrong. While explaining that the French toast didn’t match the description of the menu, a simple conversation about the menu wording and food outcome/presentation turned into a partial over explaining and back and forth, with the staff almost refusing to accept that what was given to us simply didn’t match the menu description. After having the waitress and manager come to the table multiple times and after another long wait for food, my Sorors food arrived with an amazing presentation (I should’ve taken a picture of it). Definitely not how my food, my sisters food, or my sorors original plate of food looked at all.

Inconsistency is a major issue here as well as communication. There’s no reason going back and forth, doing any over explanation, or having to send your food back to be remade should THEN lead to you receiving well prepared/presented food here in this restaurant. The manager explained that the slow service and food presentation was because everyone in the kitchen was being “trained” and the brunch menu was still “new.” To me, this didn’t make sense when this restaurant is not new; the explanation/excuse used just didn’t add up.

Think I’ve given enough chances to this restaurant at this point. I’ve been here some other times and didn’t do reviews for those experiences, because they weren’t great, but they also weren’t terrible, but this recent experience has sealed the deal for me on not coming back; very unfortunate.

The waitress mentioned she would fix our bills to accommodate for the experience we had and while paying, I noticed that the only thing really removed from each bill was basically the tax total.

About $31 spent on my order.

My overall rate of experience : 4/10",en,en,,,4.1,2025-12-01T17:02:20.621Z,30

I was assured the previous experience was just a one-off unfortunate instance and steps were taken so that it would not be a repeat occurrence.  I and my family left the restaurant today very happy and the food was outstanding.  From the appetizers, through the entries, and finishing with some wonderful desserts.

Wendy's,"725 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"Saturday  June 14,2025 12:02am Came to pick up a door dash order. I went thru drive thru. The female in drive thru said that she didn’t see any thing on her side when it came to the customers order. I was very confused because the customer order clearly was showing on my phone. She said the customer must of cancel the order. I got out of drive through Parked my car and I called the Wendy’s. Someone else picked up and I told them what happened . The person said they rebooted the system since it’s a new day and that may be a reason why the customers order didn’t show up. I asked If it was okay to go back through the drive thru and she said “yes”.  I went back through  the drive thru the same little girl saids the customer order is not up there. Well I proceeded to tell her that I called and whoever I was speaking to in the inside said they had to reboot the system since it was a new day and the customers order may not show up due to the reboot. The little girl aka employee saids and tries to lie and say she tried  to explain about the reboot the first time while trying to figure out what else to say next because she didn’t know what to say. I proceeded to get out of drive thru again. I reached out to the customer and told her the person in drive thru was very rude and unprofessional. I told the customer I’m going to call the customer service and figure out what to do. I call customer support they tell that the  customer didn’t cancel her order and to see if I could get them to make the meal and they will pay on their end. Went through the drive thru again. The employee said we only have nuggets and fries and I tell her I’m the same person from earlier and I have customer service  support on the phone. I told her what the customer service said and literally she was no help at all. She need to get fired because pretty much she’s unprofessional, she lies, she lazy and pretty much  I take that she is stealing time. Y’all don’t need to be hiring people who don’t want to work but just want to make easy money and steal time. I can tell people are hiring friends and family because people who supposed to be working are hanging out and chilling in the parking . My years of giving great customer service.

But today we went out for date day to go play pool and this place has really taken a turn for the worse. The waitress came by and took our order, in which I told her just water is fine. She comes and brings us two big waters in styrofoam cups (which we later found out are refillable from the manager Steve), she never checked on us one single time after that, then when we left we got charged $5 per cup of water. Was never explained to us at all until I spoke with Steve and was told that this is newly implemented within the past year. I’ll be honest, this place was great at one point but has really started nickle and diming. I don’t think I’ll be coming back as result of the poor communication, mediocre subpar service with expectation of tips, and getting charged for something simple as water.",en,en,,,4.5,2025-10-03T01:03:01.581Z,18

The food tasted stale, lacked basic seasoning, and undercooked! The food also arrived late and cold. For the price, the quality was extremely poor. The restaurant needs serious improvements in both kitchen execution and customer service.

Not only that, To make matters worse, within 30 minutes we became violently sick with symptoms that felt exactly like food poisoning. No restaurant should ever serve food that leaves a customer sick to their stomach—literally. The quality was terrible, the taste was questionable, and the after-effects were miserable. I will never return, and I strongly urge them to take food safety and cleanliness seriously before more customers have experiences like mine.”

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I came in and was seated immediately, which I appreciated. My server—her name sounded like Jada, though the music was loud—came over about four minutes later to introduce herself. She handed me napkins and silverware and said she’d be back. She seemed busy, so I understood, but I ended up sitting for about 10 more minutes with no follow-up.

Another server eventually noticed I was still waiting and asked if I had been helped. I explained that my server said she’d be back. Jada was standing right beside her during that interaction and still didn’t come over. They seated another party in her section, and I watched her move them and begin taking their order. I overheard her tell them that the person who originally took their order wasn’t even a server. At that point I thought maybe she’d realize I had been sitting without even being asked for a drink order.

A few minutes earlier, some staff had a quick meeting near my table about who was taking which tables. I clearly heard them mention my table—“34”—yet still no one came. Jada continued taking care of other tables, especially larger parties, while I continued to sit unacknowledged.

It honestly felt like I was being ignored because I was dining alone. I’m actually a very good tipper (even when gratuity is already included), so that was disappointing. After seeing the staff have a small heated discussion about sections and still being overlooked, I felt uncomfortable and decided to leave. At that point it just didn’t seem worth staying.

My family of 20 has visited this restaurant three times in the past two months, and we came again this Friday to celebrate a birthday. We were seated near the bar. I always order the same thing— the turkey chops — because they’re usually crispy, crunchy, and perfect.

This time, the experience was completely different.

My family’s food came out fast, so we were excited. But when I started eating, my gravy was freezing cold, like it had come straight out of the refrigerator. I even asked my waitress to touch it so she could feel it for herself, and she immediately apologized and took it back.

When my plate returned, my sides were different than what I ordered. Instead of macaroni and candied yams, it came with yams and collard greens. That wasn’t a big issue mistakes happen — and she did bring out the macaroni afterward. But the turkey wings was still ice cold, Who want a soggy turkey chop ? and the turkey chop I requested “fried hard” was soggy, not crunchy, and clearly not fresh. It tasted like it had been sitting out, not freshly cooked, and the whole plate was cold.

I made sure my waitress knew I wasn’t upset with her. She was kind, professional, and clearly doing her best. The issue was 100% coming from the kitchen.

What really added to the bad experience was the person helping bring out the food. She was noticeably rude and kept acting irritated any time she had to walk around us — even though we were celebrating, dancing, and enjoying ourselves. Instead of walking around to serve people directly, she passed plates over people and had us passing them down the table like it was an offering plate. It felt unprofessional and lazy.

After this visit, I can honestly say I won’t be returning.
The food was a 0/10, the DJ and drinks were an 8/10, my waitress deserves a 9/10, but the food runner gets a 0/10 for attitude and service.

This was at 430 in the afternoon!  Yep, never going there again. Providence rd location from now on for my family.",en,en,,,3.2,2025-04-16T21:03:35.169Z,7

Wendy's,"725 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION 725 NEWTOWN RD ON SATURDAY
THE TIME WAS ABOUT 5 PM i WAITED AT THE SPEAKER WINDOW FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE MY ORDER FOR 17 MINUTES I HAD A YOUNG LADY TELL ME TO HOLD ON BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE 3 PEOPLE WORKING AND EVERYONE ELSE HAD CALLED OUT ,, THAT TOOK 5 MIN BEFORE SHE EVER EVEN NOTICED THAT I WAS AT THE SPEAKER

IT TOOK ANOTHER 12 MINUTES FOR SOME GUY TO SAY WITH AN ATTITUDE...HEY MAM LOOK WE NEED YOU TO BE PATIENT OK?? VERY RUDE MANNER

i TOLD HIM THAT CUSTOMERS ARE DRIVING OFF  BECAUSE OF THE WAIT

AFTER HE SAID THAT TO ME HE NEVER RESPONDED AGAIN  AND WHEN i LEFT AND DROVE PAST THE WINDOW  THEIR WAS NOT EVEN A CUST AT THE WINDOW ,

i LOOKED AT HIM AND HE JUST THREW HIS HANDS UP LIKE WHAT EVER,, SOME GUY THAT HAD DREAD LOCKS IN HIS HAIR

Q-Master Billiards,"5612 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"Let’s just say it—I LOVE Q-Masters. It's got everything you’d want in a great night out: solid drinks, great food, good vibes, and pool tables that practically beg for friendly competition. But the real gem? Marisa the bartender.

Marisa is an absolute rockstar. She’s patient with the tipsy, kind to the confused, and somehow remembers your drink order after just a couple visits. Don’t know what you want? No problem—Marisa knows what’ll hit the spot. Her suggestions are always on point.

But it’s more than just drinks. Sit at the bar, and you might find yourself in one of the best conversations you’ve had all week. Buy a cocktail, get a free therapy session—no judgment, just genuine connection. Marisa listens like a friend, mixes like a pro, and makes Q-Masters feel like home.

This bar isn’t just a hangout—it’s a haven. 🍸🎱💬
Highly recommend. Marisa, you’re the best!",en,en,,,4.5,2025-08-01T11:56:21.981Z,38

The tables are well taken care of and the balls were like new.

I also got one of my cues re-tipped here and the gentleman running the service shop was a true Professional...he even played his guitar and sung a few songs while I waited for my tip replacement, awesome!

I only had a few adult beverages when I was there, but some of the people around me ordered food and it looked and smelled wonderful.

I also love the wall of pictures of the past US Open Champs, and there were also some old school wooden bleachers in the 9ft table area, I can only imagine the matches people have watched in this venue!

Overall, visiting Q-Master was a great experience.

He thought he was getting baked BBQ Chicken but couldn't believe how good the baked chicken was without any sauce. He loved it. All my food was great as well, not over or underseasoned. I also didn’t feel like I ate a heavy, greasy meal afterward. The cornbread was slamming. Oh and the tartar sauce they gave me for my fish was delicious. We got the banana pudding cheesecake too but haven’t tried it as of yet-but it looks amazing. And it’s huge.

My mom ordered the stuffed catfish and her catfish was not stuffed, we called today, and she was left on hold for over 30 minutes, and then when the manager came to the phone we were told that we couldn’t get a refund or our food replaced due to the fact if it was eaten, because it’s supposed to be checked before we leave the restaurant, which I did not know, this was our first time ever trying them, and we were also told by the manager that, due to health codes we couldn’t receive refunds, which is false.

Taco Bell,"649 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I have never once felt the urge to leave any kind of review for anything. I just had the worst experience in a fast food line in my life. I pulled up behind a truck who had just pulled up seconds before me to order. They ordered I moved up I ordered and then we both proceeded to sit in line with nobody else For 10 minutes. Finally, the truck gets their food and I pull up to the window. They took my payment, gave my card back and then proceeded to close the window and keep it closed for the next 15 minutes. No communication. They open the window, hand me three free taco coupons, and then hand me my food. Frustrated, I drove away without checking the bag. Big mistake. I get on the highway. Grab my food from the bag only to find that they had gotten the order wrong. How the hell do you make me wait 25 minutes for the wrong order, And the food that was in the bag, namely the burrito, had nothing in it. I took a bite only to find that half of my burrito was tortilla. I am dumbfounded, I waited 25 minutes for my food, Received an incorrect order on top of that the food that was served to me was subpar.

Q-Master Billiards,"5612 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,The biggest issue with Q-Masters is the owners won’t fix the air conditioners. They say that the air conditioners can’t handle the occupancy level of the people inside the establishment. That is complete hogwash. The issue is they won’t spend the money to fix the air conditioners correctly. My father has been coming to Q-Masters since wayback when Barry owned the place and he always kept the establishment chilly around like 68° because the tables play better. The bottom line is all they care about is the money coming in and they won’t fix the establishment to make it comfortable for people paying to play.,en,en,,,4.5,2025-06-18T23:42:51.697Z,1

We waited up front for awhile no one came to seat us even though staff was walking back and forth and it was not busy . I told my husband I was leaving and even though he felt out of place he decided let’s go to the bar and order food there maybe they will be faster, we went to bar my husband ordered us drinks and tried to be friendly with bartender the bartender was civil but was not as friendly as he was with  the black patrons who came through. I ordered the sliders and fries because I wanted to try to give this place a try, everyone around me was receiving food and it took way too long to get just two sliders and fries. I didn’t want drama so I told my husband pay for everything I will get a box for the food and will never return to this prejudice place again. I don’t suggest that anyone who is not Black come to this place because you surely. Won’t be welcomed.

When we arrived, we were seated right away but then sat for about 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. A staff member finally asked if we’d been helped, then said she’d find someone—who eventually came, took our order, and disappeared.

People who came in well after us received their food before we did. When our food finally arrived, it wasn’t worth the wait. The fish and mac had no seasoning, and the salmon cheesesteak was mid at best. The only things that were actually good were the yams and the salmon bites (even though I asked for them to be fried and they came out grilled).

Once the food was served, our server was nowhere to be found. We had to go looking for her just to get condiments, and again when it was time to pay. The automatic 20% gratuity definitely wasn’t earned—it honestly feels like they add it because they know the service isn’t consistent.

He ordered his usual pizza and I decided to try a salad. My salad was AMAZING. It wasn't like most Cobb salads, the toppings were so plentiful and fresh. I was very pleased. We also ended up with the sweetest waitress. I think she was relatively new but tried her very best and was overly accommodating. When the check came in was a bit surprised, I had anticipated the bill being a little higher. Overall a great place for a relatively inexpensive meal.

MP Island Café,"923 Glenrock Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,5,"MP Island Cafe is an absolute gem for anyone craving authentic West Indian cuisine. From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted with island vibes — reggae colors, tropical décor, and a warm “Wah Gwaan” that makes you feel right at home.

The food is incredible. Their jerk chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection — smoky, spicy, and tender — and the jerk sauce is on another level. They also offer a wide variety of classic Caribbean dishes like saltfish and ackee, dumplings, oxtail, and much more. Every plate tastes homemade and full of flavor.

Beyond the restaurant, MP Island Cafe doubles as a Caribbean grocery store, so you can grab essentials like dasheen bush, yams, or island spices to recreate your favorite meals at home.

If you’re looking for authentic Caribbean food with great prices, friendly service, and a true island atmosphere, MP Island Cafe is the place to go. Highly recommended!",en,en,,,4.1,2025-10-20T13:26:53.498Z,31

The beverage selection is wide and so is the alcohol (beer) selection. The best food (in my opinion) is the jerk chicken [white meat] and the two sides as a choice of mac and cheese.

There is plenty of seating since a majority of the customers order out or get delivery. You can listen to their music while you eat and it isn’t loud in there at all.

Overall, MP Island Café is a great place to go for food whether you’re eating out, dining in, or delivering to your home.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-10-15T20:33:05.310Z,5

Even though it was a bit busy, I never felt rushed, which really made me feel valued as a customer.

I’ve known about Q-Master Billiards for a long time, and today, after flying in from Vietnam, I drove three hours from Lorton to Virginia Beach just to visit this legendary pool hall. And honestly, it exceeded all my expectations.

The venue boasts 71 high-quality pool tables, all in excellent condition. The space is massive, beautifully decorated, and has a truly American vibe — both modern and cozy at the same time. What amazed me the most was the incredibly affordable pricing — only $7 for 4 hours of play, even cheaper than many places back in Vietnam.

The food here is also great. I ordered a steak haché with fries and a soft drink, all for just $11. The meal was tasty, well-portioned, and served quickly.

Another highlight of the visit was getting the chance to meet and watch some top-level American pool players — incredibly skilled and friendly.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I’ll never forget. If I ever get the chance, I’ll definitely come back to Q-Master Billiards again!",en,en,,,4.5,2025-05-17T01:51:37.885Z,105

It has that old school vibe except for the smoke and shady characters. It’s very clean, the staff are nice excellent especially Victoria, she’s a sweetheart and obviously well liked by the patrons. The prices for the tables are incredible and the food is very good. I’ve decided to join the Bollman League for socialization and to improve my game. They have several leagues apparently.  Maybe I can win a tourney LOL!

I have no qualms about bringing my wife and grandkids here for a night out. Like I said the food is very good and is moderately priced.

I look forward to establishing myself here as a loyal patron.

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,4,"This is one of my favorite spots since moving to Norfolk!

Pros:  The staff makes you feel like family.  The last time I was there, Kelsey, my favorite staffer, was training the new staff, an excellent example of great service; their menu selections and their Thursday (Karaoke) nights.  The atmosphere feels intimate, fun and leaves you with the feeling that everyone is welcomed.

The menu has an excellent selection and the food choices provides for everyone's taste from the vegan to the meat lovers.

Cons:  (and I only have one), I'm not sure if the chef rotates, but sometimes  (which I didn't experience on my recent visit) certain items can be heavy on the salt.  However, this is easily rectified by requesting that they be light on the salt.

Overall a great place to dine and get a feeling of that ""Southern Hospitality!""",en,en,,,4.1,2025-09-26T06:04:01.054Z,1

I know restaurants use left overs from the night before but it’s usually the sides not the main meats. My jerk chicken is so dry and shriveled that I have to throw it away.

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,3,"Wish I could give the food a better rating. After arriving with 25 minutes of happy hour left, unexpectedly (it was my first time at this place and didn't pick it out for the happy hour. It was just a nice surprise.), we were excited to try the available items. However, due to the large number of menu items (which all sounded great) plus the additional happy hour menu, we needed time to figure out what wanted.

We ordered get 1 set of happy hour drinks. However, our waitress failed to inform us of the timeline and when we were ready to order happy hour apps, we were informed we were 3 minutes past the cut off for happy hour. So no more happy hour drinks or apps. It would have been nice to have been given the chance to order another round of drinks and be ahead if we'd like to order some food.

So a disappointment starting the night. No big deal! However no consideration was given to our visible disappointment. Instead, ""it is what it is"" was the atmosphere provided.

We ended up getting 2 appetizers, 1 more round of drinks, then we left because just executing the items ordered took another hour. So no real dinner was had.

I will game this as a learning experience and take accountability for my party's part in this: we should have watched the clock more closely. We got excited and then disappointed, because we didn't know. Guess we know now. But will I want to come back? No, not at this moment.

Expect to spend $30/person for drinks and appetizers. Not bad prices, if you swap out entrees rather than appetizers.

The food we did get was pretty good. Though one of the salmon bites did have a foul odor/taste, indicative of being past its most fresh.

Noise did pick up later in the evening and sounded terrible once the live performers came. I think it wouldn't hurt to consult someone with acoustics knowledge on how to improve the audio experience. My simple suggestion would be to turn it down a notch. Had to yell to hear each other right at our table. The seating and general vibe otherwise were nice. And still enjoyed what we could.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-09-15T19:14:27.592Z,54

The sodas are free refills but that’s only good if your server ever came back to the table. The SCAM COMES when they give us one menu with a lower price and then charges us more then what was on the menu and when asked about it they bring us a whole different menu with a different price. As she was ring us up and we asked about the price she brought the different menu to show us the “price” then took that menu back and instead of coming back to ring us out she went to the bar and started taking someone else’s order.

Q-Master Billiards,"5612 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"I love this place so much! The biggest pool hall in the US and the original owner founded the US Open 9 Ball tournament, which is the largest running pool tournament globally!

I visited this place on Saturday night (03/22/2025) with a group of 8 to celebrate my birthday. My boyfriend and I arrived at 7:00 PM so we could start waiting for a pool table, and I told my friends to get there at 7:30. I expected to get a table by 7:40 at the latest, but we didn't get one until 8:00 PM. This situation kinda sucked because my friends ended up waiting 30 minutes with us :(. I knew there would be a wait, but I underestimated how long. That's on me for not arriving even earlier.

Once we got our pool table, we waited about 20-30 minutes for a waiter to take our first orders. Some of us went up to the bar to place drink orders instead of waiting. We even asked the front desk about it, but they said the waiters make their rounds and there wasn't much they could do. I really feel like there should be a call light, like there is at Cinema Cafe!

That said, when we finally got our service, our waitress was amazing! She was incredibly kind and patient, even with our group of eight splitting the tab in different ways lol. She made the process smooth and even offered to take a group picture (she wanted to make my birthday memorable), which I really appreciated. The only downside was that my $10 birthday credit didn't apply when she scanned my QR code, and I didn't realize until the next day when I looked at the text receipt. Partly my fault for not noticing and I'm kinda sad I can't use the credit another time due to its expiration date :(

I know this review might come off more negative than positive, but the main reason I'm still giving five stars is because of how great our server was, and because I genuinely LOVE this place :) Everyone had such a fun time (even those who rarely play pool), and honestly this was the best birthday I had in a LONG time!",en,en,,,4.5,2025-03-23T18:50:28.186Z,3

Taco Bell,"649 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,5,"Finally!!!

I conducted a very unscientific experiment over the last few months, with what was my last fast food, guilty pleasure- Taco Bell! (Specifically during Nacho Fries season- the only Fries I now ever eat and am willing to waste calories on.)

I sadly thought I was going to give up that last guilty pleasure after sampling food from many of the Taco Bell's in the area over the last few months.  10 locations in 90 days and ONLY ONE of the 10 met, and even surpassed my expectations, of getting fresh, hot, and tasty food! The meal was PERFECT!!!! 😋

I am glad to end this ""taco tour"" on a high note, and the Newtown Rd location will be the only one I recommend to others, or choose to visit in the future,  the next time I am craving my favorite ""4th meal"" (as it used to be called back in the day) although it is much more likely to be my first and only meal these days, with the combined constantly busy schedule of being a  caregiver, and the economy making eating out a major expense, that I am giving up from my budget for the upcoming year.

Thank you, kitchen staff at 649 Newtown Rd Norfolk, VA Taco Bell for finally delivering what was the best Taco Bell food, not only in the last several months, but truthfully, in the last few decades!!! They blew everybody else out of the water!!!

Specifically, I had a small order of Nacho Fries (using the Nacho Fries Lover's pass offer) with hot Nacho cheese sauce to dip them in, a Mexican pizza (which was only my 2nd time trying it ever, and which I thought I would never get again,  it was so terrible, soggy and cold the 1st time I got it.) And my last favorite- the Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco Supreme!

As with every other order, I asked if they could please prepare my order fresh after I arrived, and to please drop a fresh batch of fries, so they would be the hot, crispy, perfectly seasoned indulgence worthy of all the oh so bad for me calories and ""junk food"" cravings that have become fewer and fewer as I have aged.

The Newtown Road location was the ONLY restaurant out of the 10 to prepare my entire order fresh, piping hot, and perfectly portioned, with condiments, drink, napkins, and sauce packets as requested, both in my app order, and when arriving to the restaurant.

It seemed like more than half of the T.B. location employees actually served older, COLDER food, and often prepared the items with substandard ingredients or haphazardly throwing them together, resulty in a soggy, dishelveled, often inedible mess- AFTER  putting in a special request to prepare it fresh,  the way I remembered most restaurants to be growing up, when eating out was a treat, just as it has become once again. Although I use the term ""treat"" lightly, since only ONE of 10 hit all the marks!!

And 2 others were just slightly redeemed when they offered to remake what was arguably the absolute worst delivery of what had been my favorite yearly treat of salty, cheesy goodness of fresh, hot, perfectly seasoned, slightly crispy outside, fluffy inside potato indulgence, dunked in wonderfully hot, drippy nacho cheese dunking sauce!

The remade fries at those two did eventually meet my expectations of receiving hot, fresh and crispy seasoned fries with a small condiment cup portion of perfectly tempered cheese sauce, while the other food items consistantly were served old, cold, often soggy, and barely edible!

So, THANK YOU Newtown Road TacoBell, for finally giving me the perfect meal to end my ""local tour"" to remind me what eating fast food out used to be like, back when employees cared about their customers, their jobs, and the products they served, and almost anyone could scrape together enough coins from under the sofa cushions or car floor and still get something yummy and satisfying to eat! 😋🥤🌮🥙🍟🌯",en,en,,,3.7,2024-12-12T01:57:55.500Z,10

MP Island Café,"923 Glenrock Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,4,"MP Island Café, tucked away near Military Highway, is a true local gem that offers a delightful escape from the everyday, easily earning it a strong four-star rating. This is the place to go when you're craving authentic Caribbean and Filipino flavors, served up with genuine warmth.
The food here is consistently excellent. Their oxtail is a must-try – tender, fall-off-the-bone, and swimming in a rich, deeply flavorful sauce. The jerk chicken packs a perfect punch of spice and smoky char, and their lumpia are crispy, savory bites of heaven. What truly stands out is the authenticity; each dish tastes like it's been lovingly prepared with traditional recipes and fresh ingredients. They also offer a fantastic variety, so there’s always something new and exciting to try, whether you’re in the mood for a hearty curry or a lighter seafood dish.
The atmosphere is laid-back and welcoming. It's not a fancy place, but it's clean, comfortable, and has a no-frills charm that makes you feel right at home. It’s the kind of spot where you can relax and truly enjoy your meal. The staff are also a huge part of the appeal – friendly, attentive, and always happy to guide you through the menu if you're new to the cuisine.
While MP Island Café is fantastic, it doesn't quite hit five stars due to a couple of minor points. Given its popularity, seating can sometimes be a bit limited, especially during peak lunch or dinner rushes. Also, because everything is made fresh, there can sometimes be a bit of a wait for your food, though it's always well worth it.
Despite these minor considerations, MP Island Café is a fantastic culinary find near Military Highway. It's a vibrant, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying experience that will transport your taste buds straight to the islands. Highly recommended for anyone looking for delicious, authentic Caribbean and Filipino food in Norfolk.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-06-09T08:44:41.333Z,505

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"A horrible experience, being that it was our first time there, we asked to sit at the table close to the bar. The waiter said OK, so we headed over. As we sat there and waited, there were tables next to us getting service and no one had yet come to our table. Then a lady walks up and tells us that we had to be seated, which we explained that we were, and then we were told that we were not seated and that our table needed to be turned on. All of that happened in 10 minutes. As we were ordering, I asked for the crab balls and boom shrimp, which took forever to come out. In fact, my wife’s pasta dish came out before the shrimp, which was weird. Upon tasting her pasta, it tasted like it came straight out of a box and the toast was freezer burnt. Halfway through her dish, the shrimp I ordered arrived, and because it was overcooked It was extremely tough, like chicken, so I told the waiter there was no way I could eat it. Irritated by the awful experience, I asked for the check and, on top of the tasteless experience, the tab was $110, which we felt that we were overcharged, but we paid it and would never come back.

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,5,"IMO, this is one of the best soul food restaurants in the area. Nice portions for the amount, flavorful and well seasoned food, and strong drinks. Our server Ciara W was amazing. She made sure we were doing well throughout the meal and even gave me a free dessert for my birthday.  For 3 people with starters, drinks, entrees, and desserts, the bill came up to $234.19 including a 20% gratuity added for dine-in. We brought a lot of food home. Please go try this place out to keep them around. Boss Queens is needed for this area!!

Boss Queens Soul Cafe,"5802 E Virginia Beach Blvd #140, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,5,"I am a trained cook from California. This place was a wonderful surprise. Behind what looks like a small ordinary looking building lies something that is just amazing.
A place that feels like a mixture of home and fine dining. I swore my grandma was in the kitchen making potato salad.
The drinks were above expectation, no skimping on the booz And no bottom shelf booz!
The stuffed fish, wings, smothered pork chops made a family of 6 just sit and eat without words it was so good.
The atmosphere was lively and family friendly!
The staff was super friendly, kind, and helpful.
Queen herself (owner) happened to be there and she was supper pleasant and kind. This is going to be my new favorite place to eat in Hampton roads!! That’s right not just Norfolk but the whole area!
Go try it if you love amazing food and libations. libations!

MP Island Café,"923 Glenrock Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,5,"It had been almost a year since my last visit because I live in NC, but I have to bring my mom here anytime we are in VA. My Jamaican mother has a discerning palate, and this is the only Caribbean food that passes her tests. She also likes to hit up the grocery section for items she can't find locally.

We were blessed to arrive at a time when there was hardly a line. Throughout years of patronage, we have waited in a long line at every location of this restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food is worth the wait, and the line is part of the experience, but it was so nice to be able to order right away. I immediately noticed some items available on the hot bar like ackee and saltfish - I hadn't seen that offered before. I'd also never seen every pattie variety available at once. I was happy to be able to have the veggie and the spinach and cheese as vegetarian options.

The staff was wonderful. They were patient with my mother who still is never ready to order when it's her turn😅. The staff also graciously navigated another issue when I attempted to pay for our food. I hadn't noticed my mom ordering another entree and changing the size of her plates. The staff informed me discreetly, easily figured the difference, and quickly sorted everything out.

We then went to the grocery side where my mom idly browsed the aisles. We were greeted by a very nice young man who was stocking shelves. This same young man was our cashier and he was so polite and kind and helpful. He took his time with my mom's items and loaded bags into her cart. I was so impressed, he was clearly raised very well. I wish I got his name because he deserves to be recognized. Please let him know he is doing an excellent job and I wish him well in life. It is so nice to encounter truly kind people, especially when they are young.

Anyway, I digress, the food was excellent. I brought a large oxtail dinner home for my husband, and he cleaned the plate. My hot patties were delicious, and I also purchased the unbaked, frozen versions of them from the grocery. I also stocked up on hot sauce and snacks. Best visit so far.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-05-18T22:29:14.174Z,4

Most restaurants keep seafood on another side for a reason lol they just need to keep the fish at the very end and Make sure it ain’t dripping into other areas when serving customers. Luckily I’m not allergic to seafood 😂",en,en,,,4.1,2025-04-22T16:52:20.075Z,24

They ignored my family at the counter. We waited until we gave up and used the kiosk. This, despite having made eye contact several times with numerous associates.

They were quick to help the next group that didn't look like us. I feel like we were discriminated against.

Our order was wrong. Several items were made incorrectly. The associate argued that point. When they remade those items, they were rolling their eyes, being rough with the food, and making rude comments to their co-worker while they laughed about it.

I'm really at a loss here.  I can't recall ever having such an unbelievably bad experience just trying to grab dinner for the kids.

Mind you that our little ones are two and four and the employees were so disrespectful in front of them.

I will absolutely not be returning to this location. I've been living in Hampton Roads for 18 years. This area is my home, and this ""restaurant"" has forfeited a lifetime of business from my family.

Taco Bell,"649 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,2,"Based on my experience, it appears that the staff at the establishment may not be fulfilling the orders as per the customer's request. For instance, when I order extra cream, cheese, or other toppings, it seems that the staff ignores my request, even though I have paid for it. I think that the hiring manager and the leads should take responsibility for this issue, as it may be a result of the establishment's culture. It's possible that the staff is not being trained properly or is not being held accountable for their actions.

While I understand that no fast food place is perfect, it's essential to ensure that the staff follows simple instructions and takes care of the customers. After all, customers are the backbone of any business. If the establishment can improve its culture and hire people who truly care about the customers, it will make a positive difference. It's crucial to create an environment where the staff is motivated to do their best, and the customers are satisfied with the service.",en,en,,,3.7,2024-04-17T10:17:37.699Z,21

Chinatown restaurant,"4848 Virginia Beach Blvd #11, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"So I'm always worried about new Chinese delivery because they are notoriously famous for no descriptions or photos. I totally understand why independent owners struggle with making that a priority financially. I was impressed with the portion sizes and the food came super hot which for delivery is impressive. The prices were some of the lowest which I loved.
My items:
1. Pork Egg Fu Young. Came with 3 decent sized omelets, white rice, and a generous portion of gravy. The gravy was thick and very flavorful. It was rich and delicious. This is how I rate Chinese food and for this I'd give it a 5 out of 5.
2. Pork Lo Mein. A quart size was packed full. The sauce was tasty and the pork was pretty tender. Not a huge amount of pork but for the price I was OK with it.
3. Smoked Sausage and Fried Rice. The sausage was generous and tasted great. A little char from the frying which made it even better. The rice wasn't any traditional fried rice (there was no brown color from a soy sauce). It has no flavor in my opinion but I ordered extra gravy and I added this which made it so much better.
4. Fried scallops. Came golden brown. The scallops are from frozen but really sweet and a great crispy coating. In the picture I added flaky garlic salt because everything fried needs it in my opinion.
5. The fried chicken potstickers were super small but tasted great. I got them free from an advertisement so I can't complain!  The dumpling sauce was awesome!
I will definitely be ordering from there again!

They gave me a great table, despite not having a reservation and it only got better from there.
I had the short ribs - AMAZING is all I can say. Really didn't need a knife as the meat fell of the bone and was covered with a wine reduction sauce that was fabulous. In addition,the gouda dish accompanying the ribs gave a whole new meaning to ""mac and cheese""!
I also ordered a their side salad. It was very fresh and arranged so nicely that I almost hated to ruin it by eating - Ha!

They laughed chatted etc while I'm at the register just standing there ...one employee Indian lady I think not sure  but had her hand all in her shirt untucked scratching her back with her bare hands her work uniform looked like it need to be washed... And few minutes later after I watched her scratch all up on her skin n back n watched her touch peoples food n bag then walked over to me n said what are u waiting for I said my frappe I already paid she makes a smirk n walks off goes behind wall makes the drink n comes n sets it  far away from me on the counter n says it's right der like really u working that hard laughing n talking n scratching her sweaty body n not washing her hands that u couldn't hand me my order... Which I refused to drink cause she didn't wash her nasty hands after being on the front line in front of customers  doing what she wasn't supposed to do the white manager or employee a lady then gets rude with me cause I said I don't want what she touched... So now two employees are acting in a rude n disgusting manner it was uncalled for  and they both should know better n do better I am and have been a manager in restaurant all my life and no this is unacceptable service ..rude and disgusting behavior I could see from a child but 2 grown adults unacceptable next time I'll record it oh and by the way..this mcds for a small frappe it is 440 before tax for a smalllllll.... The other mcds around the corner about 1 n half miles away the small is only 2 dollars ... The med n large are more than what's priced at other mcds too may I suggest y'all go to a different one because this one is over priced and needs proper training on hospitality and health hazards...,en,en,,,3.4,2025-10-14T00:31:56.286Z,43

The girl who answered the phone said they were shutting everything down for the night.  NOT cool when they could have made another sale before closing.  Aside from that I have never had a bad experience at this location.  I would have given a better review but I am very disappointed when they weren't even closed yet and refused to take my order.  I really suggest that in the future that a post a cutoff time for ordering food.  Otherwise they need to take orders accordingly until they reach their closing time,en,en,,,4.4,2025-09-29T02:01:13.210Z,28

We placed a mobile order and I asked the lady at the first window if I should proceed to the 1st or 2nd pickup window (there were two pickup orders), and she said the second window (which had a big “two” over it).  We proceeded to wait there for over 20 minutes for our food, which they apparently gave away to another person in the drive-through.  Workers were also rude to my wife when she went inside to figure out what was going on.  They then told us it was our fault we went to the wrong window (even though I went to the window I was told to go to), never apologized for our food being delayed, and then couldn’t even give us the correct order at the end (I had to ask twice for our drinks), and they were out of Coke after all this.

Sal’s NY Slice Pizzeria,"5604 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,3,"This has become my go to pizza place. I live in the neighborhood so it’s real easy to get to. The issue I’ve had is that every time I order, I order the same thing and every time the price is different. Sometimes it’s $22 , sometimes it’s $25, sometimes it’s $19. Yesterday it was $29. We always order an 18 inch pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. Now the price roulette as we call it isn’t usually an issue, but yesterday it was cause definitely didn’t have extra cheese after I just paid the most I’ve ever paid for the same pizza at the same place. The consistent inconsistencies is making me feel it’s time to search for another pizza place sadly.",en,en,,,4.4,2025-07-22T11:39:02.083Z,5

It was early Sunday in the afternoon and this pizza place caught my eye while driving by.
I figured why not get a pizza slice.
I was welcomed with a clean and neat interior with simple chairs and tables with blue, well designed, covers and a friendly woman working the register.
After asking for a menu, I saw they offered a lot more than your popular Italian pie.
So, I didn't ask for a slice. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and broccoli instead.
My salad that it came with was fresh complete with red onions, green peppers, croutons, and crisp lettuce which was not at all soggy. Of course, I had to have ranch with it.
The Alfredo pasta was almost authentically perfect with the sauce made from parmesan according to the nice woman. I added more parmesan from the shaker which contributed a more powdered texture to my meal. The sauce was rich and creamy. The shrimp was tender and the broccoli added a soft crunch. I liked it! You can tell the meal had this homemade charm and it tasted like it. It was quite good!
The soft bread was delicious with a punch of garlic and butter but not too overwhelming. It was not brittle or dry and it was tasty!
Overall, a nice charming takeout or sit down place where you can enjoy a delightful meal guaranteed to leave you full!",en,en,,,4.4,2025-07-13T22:25:06.028Z,10

Sal’s NY Slice Pizzeria,"5604 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"The worst pizza I've had in a long time.  Stopped here for lunch. The place being entirely empty should have been a red flag, but we were hungry and we were already here. The pizza was incredibly bland. Total lack of flavor.  The sauce reminded me of those pizzas we were served in the middle school cafeteria. The cheese was very low quality. The crust had zero taste, although it was at least cooked right.  The toppings didn't taste fresh at all.  If you told me this pizza was frozen before being cooked, I would believe you.  We each ate one slice and left hungry.  It simply wasn't worth eating, even after paying $30 for it.

The owner responded, claiming that we must have been reviewing the wrong location.  I can assure you this is the location that we visited.  It's right between a billiards place and Dunkin.  There is a huge werewolf on display inside of the restaurant.",en,en,,,4.4,2025-03-21T00:45:41.442Z,1

Big Apple Pizzeria,"928 Diamond Springs Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"Ordered through door dash on 3/30. They offered a special of wings, a pizza, and some garlic knots but it wouldn’t allow me to pick the toppings on the pizza or the flavor of wings so I figured I’d just call the place and talk to them about it. Before I could call them a woman working that day called me and lectured me about how I shouldn’t be ordering through door dash because they charge more and next time I need to call them directly. She said if she hadn’t been working they would have just made everything plain and not bothered calling to check if that’s what I wanted. Well, there won’t be a next time. I had no idea this place existed except for through door dash, nor did I have any idea they would deliver to me. As far as I know, your business has to volunteer to be on door dash so why am I being scolded for using it? I understand there were some technical difficulties but that should be taken up with DoorDash, not me.

I still ordered the food regardless. I asked for garlic park wings and they tasted very lemony. I threw them out. The garlic knots were pretty dry and the pizza was average. I’m happier ordering dominos",en,en,,,4,2025-04-06T14:48:43.218Z,2

I know a lot of people are ordering through apps now but small local owned restaurants like this can really use families coming in and sitting down like they used to. In addition, they have the best Christmas treats around. You have to order them way ahead of time.
Edit: while the quality of the food has not changed, as they try to update and use delivery services or deliver themselves there has been a problem on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, we have ordered twice and both times they was delivered early . Last evening, 11/21/25, the order for delivery was for 6:00 to 6:15 p.m. showed up an hour early, and was ice cold. I called the restaurant, they offered no solution. The big issue for me is not paying attention to order details and I tipped well. Just as though I were in the restaurant.

The crust is thin, but chewy in every sense, how do they do that. The sauce is more tomatoe-y than spicy, not zesty, not sour... and not too simple either - I like tomato flavor.  I thought the toppings were a little skimpy and unpressive, but since the dough is so thin and chewy, its a good ratio.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed and unlikely to return. I ordered Vegetable fried rice and added a request to include less broccoli and more mushrooms. Well...it doesn't generally include either SO they charged me an extra $2. Barring these two [added] vegetables, there was really only onions. So I guess Vegetable fried rice means rice with onions. But wait... the bigger issue really lies in the fact that there was MORE broccoli than mushrooms. I had what would be equivalent to 1 mushroom in my fried rice. To make matters worse... it was flavorless. Bland. Unseasoned. 😒
The Vegetable pancit was just ok. But it too was flavorless. Bland and unseasoned. I mean soy sauce can only do so much. 🙄",en,en,,,4.3,2024-02-02T02:52:39.005Z,309

Bodacious Pizza & Grill,"309 Aragona Blvd #106, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,Went tonight for dinner and ate in.  I had the Mediterranean pizza and my boyfriend had a supreme and we shared garlic nots   My boyfriend tipped 20% when we ordered and paid at the register first.  Both pizzas came out with burnt bubbles in both pizzas and my boyfriends crust was black burnt on one whole side of the pizza.  Why kind of cook thinks that’s ok to serve to your customers.  What did we tip ahead for?   Got up and refilled our drinks and got up to ask for a to go box.  The picture I’m posting is half of each of our pizzas we took home…just for picture purposes.  Won’t be going back and definitely wouldn’t recommend.  Wasted our money!,en,en,,,4.6,2025-06-06T01:10:48.898Z,6
Bodacious Pizza & Grill,"309 Aragona Blvd #106, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"⭐ 1 Star (Only because 0 isn’t an option)

Absolutely unacceptable service. I placed a delivery order for a pizza and waited nearly two hours with no update, no courtesy call, nothing. After getting tired of waiting, I tried calling the restaurant. The phone rang four times with no answer. On the fifth attempt, someone finally picked up, said a half-hearted “hello,” then sat in silence before hanging up on me.

This is hands-down one of the worst customer service experiences I’ve ever had. No food, no explanation, no professionalism. If you’re hungry and thinking of ordering from here, do yourself a favor—don’t. There are plenty of places that actually care about their customers and can manage a simple pizza delivery without ghosting you.

Trash service. Total waste of time. Never again.",en,en,,,4.6,2025-05-27T00:26:26.325Z,16
Bodacious Pizza & Grill,"309 Aragona Blvd #106, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"This restaurant is consistently excellent. I have tried and tested them many times. Not once have they failed to produce an excellent product. The persons are certainly kind to their customers. I don't know why I waited as long as I have to write this review. This pizza is some of the best I've had in my life.

Granted, you will spend more here than you would at Domino's or Little Caesars. Budget savvy persons May feel a little bit uneasy about paying twice the cost of a Domino's Pizza. Nevertheless, the pizza is worth every single penny. I highly recommend this restaurant.",en,en,,,4.6,2025-05-19T13:57:49.208Z,116

Visited interlude this past Mothers Day for breakfast. The food was awesome but my waitress *Grace delivered the food and the check about 30 secs later.  I was in a state of shock but continued to watch other tables in my area to see maybe if the same thing was happening. Sad to say it wasn't. Giving her the benefit of the doubt , maybe her shift was ending early and she forgot to mention it or maybe she was changing areas in the restaurant all of which proved to not be true. We ate for another 30 minutes or so giving plenty of time to enjoy the food and see if she'd ask about the bill. That did not happen. I paid leaving $0 tip of course and took a picture of the receipt and was sure to use my Amex Gold Business card due to the ease of which I could dispute and track if a tip would be added afterwards. Sorry to say that's indeed what happened. Grace added a little over $4 bucks for a $41 dollar meal. Its not $ of course , the principal. Ive since disputed and AMEX is on the case. Very very unfortunate but I refuse to be taken advantage of and be made to feel like a 2nd class citizen.",en,en,,,4.1,2022-05-11T01:55:33.639Z,8

I haven't had a pizza with proper seasoning, great crust, and great bacon in a long time. I was absolutely astonished by just how good it was. Got fried mushrooms as well, due to never seeing as a option. The mushrooms were really juicy and were actually really nice. The breading on the mushrooms was nicely crunchy. The pizza reminded my wife of New york. Definitely getting it again",en,en,,,4,2024-07-30T01:40:46.307Z,5

Best meatball marinara sub in the area, really great Philly, but the pizza is just phenomenal. Perfect NY style thin crust, tangy perfect sauce, piping hot cheese. Toppings are great but the ingredients and execution are so good that just plain cheese or pepperoni is fantastic. Service is exceptional and the chef works his tail off every single day to deliver a consistent excellent product.

We told her I love philly cheese steaks and I was looking for a new place. I ordered a sub, extra meat extra cheese and banana peppers no green peppers. It was delicious. Extra meat is 1.75 extra cheese is 1.75 as well. They also charge for banana peppers there is supposed to be no substitutes.

So tonight 12/8/2023 Went back since it was good first time and ordered same thing. It was not good this time and my sub literally looked like it had no extra meat extra cheese which I asked for. She assured me it was when I called back. If this is what extra meat is how much meat goes on a regular one. Not satisfied at all. I thought I had found me a new place but I'm good because this was not acceptable. Almost 16 for a sub that can't be what they say it is.

McDonald's (Newtown Rd),"745 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"NOW SERVING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR NON-BLACKS AT THIS LOCATION - A.K.A DISCRIMINATION!
I came to this establishment to pick up an order for someone, and when I entered, there wasn't a team member at the register. On the other side of the counter was a Caucasian female with her two adolescent children. We were both waiting to be served. The Caucasian woman, in her impatience, elevated her tone so the team members in the kitchen could hear and asked ""can we get some help over here?"" Another Caucasian female with a short, blonde hair cut, dressed in all black walked out and asked the annoyed woman with two children what she needed. I stood at the pickup counter and waited patiently to be recognized, and instead, the white team member refused to acknowledge me. So I kindly said as she was passing, ""excuse me, I'm here to pick up and order for [insert name here]."" She quickly interjected as I was talking and replied, ""it will be out when it's ready,"" then walked away. I immediately left the store and canceled the order. NOT TODAY SATAN! Her real irritation was toward the Caucasian female with two adolescent children, but instead she chose to use me as target practice - the kind African American woman who spoke to her with RESPECT! You must be out of your mind to think that I would accept that projection. I didn't deserve the disrespect, but the white woman with two kids surely did. Why did she think it was remotely acceptable to be rude to me? Two women are in front of her: one white, one black. One rude, one respectful, and yet she targeted the black, respectful one. Call it racist, call it discriminatory, call it a bad day, call it whatever you want! I call it disgusting and unacceptable. If you are African American, I urge you NOT to spend your dollars and cents here. They do not treat black people like they are worthy of common courtesy.

You can put one topping on each of the pizzas if you want or you can just get cheese.
The pizza is thin crust and was definitely pretty good. It reminded me of a very similar style to NYC pizza and I prefer that style myself. We also got the garlic knots and they were delicious. It's like they put a whole loaf in the oven and just infused it with garlic flavor! The portions for that were large!

FRESHQuality

Every single order has been consistently great! Yes, I said GREAT. Best ribs compared to every other place I have tried and there have been many. I have ordered my favorite ( Ribs & ragoons) many times here and they are always a good quality, well cooked, fresh and you taste the fresh orange peel bits in the sauce. The sweet and sour sauce is always fresh tasting with the hint of pineapple juice like it should be. Wooo Hooo. 🥳

Last time I tried the pork with vegetables and again was the best compared to any other place as well. Large chunks of fresh mixed vegetables and chunks of lotus root which was a nice surprise, not itty bitty slivers.

*when you order the ribs they always staple the container and if it’s too saucy they wrap it in plastic wrap so it doesn’t spill. Thank you.

I applaud the owners and workers. 🙌🏻 They are always  friendly when Tom goes to pick our food up. They clearly make and pack it with pride and love!

It is SO REFRESHING to have found a quality establishment. As much as I wanted to keep this place to myself they deserve the acknowledgment.",en,en,,,4.3,2022-03-04T01:57:40.692Z,11

Sal’s NY Slice Pizzeria,"5604 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,4,"First time at Sal's. Decent pizza, I wish all non-pork pepperoni was this good. All the meats are pork free. I had one slice,  $4. It was decent, with good flavor. Sauce had a nice tang, and the cheese was okay. Not as good as the Benny's chain and perhaps just a bit under Delvecchio's, but a decent slice. Foldable.

The service was very nice. People are terrific here, very helpful, and kind. The standard slice condiments were there, and I availed myself off the cheese, cracked red pepper flakes, and a touch of garlic.

The dining room was clean and neat with a giant monster dominating the room. I don't know why it's there, but I did enjoy its presence.

I would go back. Nice people, lower price point. Better than Marco's across the street, but only just better.

#3: I absolutely LOVED their meat selection being 100% pork free! Their beef pepperoni and beef+Turkey sausage had better flavor than their pork counterparts.

I saw someone scratch their face and continue restocking, another person playing on their phone, etc. Lucky for me the guy making my pizza seem to be taking the proper precautions. I probably won't return just based off of cleanliness of the staff. However, as I previously stated the food tastes really good.. I've had it quiet few times from friends bring it to me.

Getting the food, it arrived cold, and the special request for our food was not followed. (we don't live far, so it wasn't on the Dasher part of receiving it cold) We drove back up there to get the order remade and at the drive-thru, we repeated back the order. Getting the food the second time! It was still made incorrectly, and the manager on duty, Josie, said it was our fault. She was very unsympathetic to our situation and offered a half-hearted apology. I am very disappointed with the customer service. It was a considerable inconvenience and defeated the whole point of Uber! To the manager, I’d recommend you learn to stop being combative when you are clearly at fault. Just because you remade the food doesn't mean you did your “job” that's only half of it. Customer service goes hand in hand.  Cutting off someone and saying your robotic “I apologize” isn't manager status.

McDonald's (Newtown Rd),"745 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,1,"I used to love this location and would literally drive out of my way to come here, but lately it’s been awful, stale old food, and order messed up every single time.
I placed my order, drove up to the window, they said they’re having register issues and wanted me to wait. That’s not their fault. However, I watched my food sit at the windowsill for the full 25 minutes, and the manager looked me dead in the face and STILL tried to hand it out to me. I asked her nicely to please remake my entire order.. no reason I should have to eat that. She was nice about it, but why did she try to give it to me in the first place? I pull to the third window to wait for my food. The manager with the short ginger hair is always so rude and always has an attitude, and she was rude at this pickup window as well. Mad at me because I don’t want rock solid food.. Half of my order was missing! So I had no choice but to go inside. With customer service here these days, when you go inside the building, you get fully neglected. Looked at 10 times but nobody asks you if you need help. And I’m the most understanding when it comes to mistakes, but it seems to be the same mistakes every time. The time before this, they forgot my mcchicken, I went in, and the manager with the long brown hair literally grabbed an old mcchicken out of the till; walked it back to the kitchen yelling “can you add pickles to this??” right in front of me.. there’s absolutely no shame. Today I decided to go for breakfast and they gave me a muffin that was hard as a rock and tasted like it’s been sitting out all morning. Old food is the trend here.

Big Apple Pizzeria,"928 Diamond Springs Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"I decided to try this place after finding their pamphlet in the mail.  I've had some poorly prepared food before, but this place has successfully topped them all.  Not only was our food poorly made and overcooked, all the ingredients used in our meals tasted exceptionally cheap.

My son got the NY Buffalo Chicken wrap and couldn't finish it.  He complained that the chicken was mushy, the sauce was really salty, and the wrap was dry without the ranch dipping sauce.  I took a bite and can confirm everything he said was true.  Despite the salty flavor and mushy texture, it was at least edible.

I got the stuff shells.  It was a lesson and a reminder to never order this unless you can confirm the expertise of the chef.  It looked edible, but I was disappointed after cutting into it.  The mozzarella cheese they use was probably the cheapest you can buy and was so baked on that it was like cutting into rubber.  I'm assuming the shells were stuffed with Ricotta cheese, but it was so dry, flavorless, and gritty that I couldn't really tell what it was.  I got halfway through the meal, and couldn't stomach the rest.

My wife got the Gyro.  There was so much grease in it that it actually broke the Tzatziki sauce and turned the pita into mush.  She had thrown it away before I could snap a picture of it, and I wasn't about to fish it out of the garbage.  She tried to eat it, but the mushy pita bread and nasty broken sauce were deal breakers for her.

Normally, I give a place a few tries even after a bad experience.  But, to fail so completely from start to finish on every item in my order is inexcusable and undeserving of future patronage.",en,en,,,4,2022-06-01T01:57:20.274Z,12

I called my order in over the phone . when I went to pick up my food, I took it to the car and I realized that one of the dishes that I ordered, which was shrimp tempura looked half done. It wasn’t deep fried and I took the shrimp tempura back into the restaurant, and I politely asked the staff to deep fry it it tasted u cooked. the lady who worked there took it to the kitchen however, the man who work behind the counter who’s picture Ihave attached. This young man started cursing at me and told me if I didn’t like it for me to get out and threatened to Throw me out .there was approximately six or seven other customers in the restaurant at the time they were all Caucasian. I believe that because I was a black African-American female, the man behind the counter, thought it was OK for him to curse me out and speak to me in a disrespectful manner. Of course, I put him in his place and let him know that I’m a retired officer, and my money was given back to me. I felt that this was a racist move and that I wouldn’t recommend other customers of color to visit this restaurant. From now on, I’ll drive to the other Sakura restaurant on Lynnhaven Parkway because the food is good the atmosphere is good and the customer service is excellent.

Sakura Japanese Restaurant,"4716 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I wish I could give a NEGATIVIE 5-star review.  Customer Service is awful. Have been to the one Shore Dr and Hampton Rd, and it’s night and day. PLEASE do not go to this place.

I wanted to take my son out for some father-son time. We arrived and seated right after another customer and was given the menu and took our drink orders. After 15 or so minutes, we are still waiting to place our order while the customer who came in right before us were able to place their orders and receive their food. I literally had to get up and walk to the front and ask if someone could please take our order. Finally, he came over to take our orders for miso soup, rolls, and sushi. After over 30 mins, our soup came. I made a statement “looks like you guys are busy tonight.” There are only 2 other tables occupied. I told him when he bring our food out if he could please bring our check out also. Instead of “sorry for the delay”, he got super defensive and said if I don’t like the service, I can leave. I did not feed into his rude comments/gesture and said, ""Please bring our food out when you can."" He responded “you leave now” As embarrassed as I was, I asked to speak to the manager, and he pulled out a chair and sat down and said,"" What do you want? "" I asked if he was the manager, and he kept going on. My son and I got up and left.

I've never been kicked out of a restaurant before, especially with my son. This place customer service has the most horrific experience. They give a bad name to the restaurant name “Surka” and should change their name. Will never go back here ever again even if they give out food for free.

Out of loads of sushi places I have visited, their rice has a proper lightly roasted taste to it. This is rare to find, the rice temperature is also matched to the dish you order. That said, fish is fresh but the cook excels in chicken based dishes. The dish shown above is their Chicken teriyaki. All featured items shown are not muffled, each pronounces their unique flavors while still working alongside the sauces. Nothing I tasted is overwhelming and plays well together. Also! This place is quiet! Even on a Friday, holiday weekend. Mainly visited by reoccurring locals, you can actually sit and enjoy your meal here without being pressured to eat quickly.

Big Apple Pizzeria,"928 Diamond Springs Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,5,Christmas eve and about one of the only places open.  I have been here numerous times and the food is always good.  This particular day I ordered through door dash and their system had problems with door dash orders.  They completed the order once they found it.  One of the workers grabbed the wrong pizza and gave it to me.  It was still delicious just missing half pepperoni.  The Stromboli was really good too.

I kindly told the lady that she put the wrong dressing on. I had the sandwich remade as I have had the ""vinegar sauce"" before and it gives me a headache and I don't like the flavor. When I get to the check out I am told I have to pay for BOTH sandwiches. $26 later I paid for two sandwiches and walked away with only one. I should have just walked out and not paid, but it was so awkward. Totally blown away. I asked why I had to pay for the sandwich she made wrong and was just told, ""Sorry, they say you have to pay"" after she spoke in a different language to the other two men behind the counter. When I asked who is ""they"" and requested to speak to a manager...the lady said there was no manager. Obviously, I will never go to this location again.

Big Apple Pizzeria,"928 Diamond Springs Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,1,"I just ordered a pizza (which was overcooked) and a pizza steak sub with double meat and I wish I could upload a pic of it so the owner can see how horribly skimpy this sub is. It's almost like the cook, who is a terrible cook btw, gave me less than the normal amount of meat. I certainly miss when the brothers were on the grill. Not sure if they're brothers but the guy with the gold fronts is awesome on the grill. I tried to take the sub back in there and the guy swore it was double meat. I may not go back there. Very unsatisfied. This new cook you've hired is going to run your business into the ground",en,en,,,4,2021-05-05T21:41:10.661Z,5

Subway,"665 Newtown Rd #105, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"As I stepped into the welcoming ambiance of the Subway on Fifth Avenue, the staff's delightful demeanor promised an extraordinary culinary experience. The sandwich at hand—a bold meld of tuna and pepperoni, enlivened by sharp jalapeños and smoothed over with creamy mayonnaise, all encased in an Italian herb and cheese bread—was a gastronomic saga in itself. The ensemble of flavors was impeccably balanced, with each ingredient playing its part to elevate the simple sandwich into a memorable meal.

This creation was a vivid testament to Subway's culinary artistry, challenging and comforting the palate in equal measure. The passionate recommendations from the engaging staff only enhanced the experience, embodying the spirit that great culinary art can indeed emerge from the most unexpected places. As Anton Ego would appreciate, this was not just a sandwich; it was a small, sublime slice of life served with a smile.",en,en,,,4,2024-05-18T20:36:58.442Z,133

I didn't realize that serving moldy food at a restaurant was justifiable, but it is in this woman's eyes.

I picked up beef and broccoli and some house fried rice.  I did not realize this was a sit down restaurant and not just a takeout place.  It was late so they were about to close for the night but a large family was finishing up and they had a ton of food in front of they.   It comes in the traditional white paper containers you have seen in movies for the last few decades.  I always like these.   The beef and broccoli was solid, great sauce and the broccoli was not over cooked and tasted fresh.     The house fried rice was solid also.   Ate that for lunch.

Lots of staff were there but no one came by to take our order. We had to stop a worker just to get a menu and stop another to place the order. We were hungry so got a few of the service cart appetizers. Given cold fried rice and semi warm dumplings. The broccoli and beef we got was really good when it came out.

Kept asking for To go boxes and the server apologized and said he had to was his hands. Not sure why washing your hands takes 10 minutes...

My mother in law really like this place and goes often but she said the service this time around was unusually terrible. Im a restaurant server too and I get the kitchen was likely slow but the service staff worked like they were burned out.

"Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar& karaoke (Town Center)","4830 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Absolutely the worst restaurant experience I’ve had in a long time.

Our group was accused of damaging equipment after their own server placed a water dispenser too close to the edge of the table. When someone stood up, it accidentally fell. Only two people in our group were drinking—and it wasn’t even one of them who knocked it over. Water went everywhere, and we immediately informed our server.

They sent someone in to clean it, but she just spread the water around the small room, soaking a cord that was already lying across the floor when we first arrived. Shortly after, the manager stormed in and accused us of breaking a “$2,000 piece of equipment.” I tried to calmly explain what had happened, but she completely ignored me and walked out.

I had to repeatedly ask for someone to come back and explain the situation. When she finally returned, she told us we had to leave immediately—but that she “wouldn’t charge us” for the equipment. When I asked her to prove it was broken, she said she couldn’t because the microphone stand it supposedly connected to was damaged. Laughable.

They made us leave 20 minutes early and still charged us the full hourly room fee. The waitress and other staff were kind until the manager got involved. After that, their attitude flipped and they became incredibly rude. I’m truly appalled at the way we were treated. Avoid this place.",en,en,,,4,2025-07-18T23:04:14.694Z,7

Our sever did check on us twice when were looking at the menu but after that I felt like we got abandoned. The service was like this take order and we are done. I do hope you servers read this I am a server myself and I work at a Mexican restaurant and I get new people come in and they ask for some time because they need to read the menu but not whole lot of time it’s always about 5 to 10 minutes to check on your customers. You always have to be able to multitask on your drinks, food, and customers. It all about having to multitask and having to work as a team. But other than that the food was really good and loved how we got fresh tortilla made. The atmosphere was kind of awkward because servers kept checking at our tables but not us the whole time. They seemed to be talking a lot with the guys at the bar. I’m just upset that whenever we needed something we had to ask the server who came by for the table in front of us.

Fu Hing Restaurant,"5635 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,4,"So, the reviews seem mixed. Having ordered from them, I feel like they deserve an objective review. My biggest issue was that it took 50 minutes to get food delivered, restaurant was 4 min from my hotel, on a Tuesday night. It was irritating, but things happen. I did order 20min before delivery cutoff

First item, egg drop wonton soup. This item was EXCELLENT, some of the best I've had from a strip mall Chinese place. Cooked perfectly, wontons were nice, and three of them in a pint of soup.  Broth was delicious, thick and rich. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Egg Roll, basic, garden variety. Needed a few more minutes to cook. Not bad, not great. ⭐⭐⭐

Shrimp Lo Mein, it was good, nice taste, not too dry, not too saucy. Noodles weren't soggy, and veggies had a little crunch to them, even tho l had to microwave them to reheat. Could have used a few more shrimp, but even the shrimp were cooked right, not tough and overcooked.
⭐⭐⭐⭐

So, to review, the food was satisfying , filling, and good. I would order from them again, if I were local. More of a lunch place for me. I'd think it's the sort of place that if you're a regular and pickup your own food, it's probably a much better experience.",en,en,,,4,2024-10-16T02:33:29.804Z,37

"Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar& karaoke (Town Center)","4830 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Review: 1/5 Stars
We recently visited Volcano with a group of friends from work, eager to have a great time as we’ve enjoyed karaoke nights before at another spot. Unfortunately, our experience here was disappointing from the start.
We were excited by the setup, which included a huge selection of songs and the ability to use YouTube, but the service was completely unacceptable. Upon arrival, we waited at the bar to order drinks while our room was being set up, but no one attended to us. After finally ordering, it took over 45 minutes to get our first round of drinks. I also ordered an appetizer, but it didn’t arrive until the very last plate of food, as it was apparently forgotten by the kitchen staff. The waitress was quick to assure us it wasn’t her fault but didn’t take responsibility for the delay.
To make matters worse, while one of my friends was singing, the manager came in and turned down the microphones so low that we couldn’t hear anything. We mentioned this to the staff and hoped they’d adjust the volume, but the response was unsatisfactory. Instead, the music became unbearably loud, making it nearly impossible to enjoy the karaoke experience.
Throughout the night, the staff was inattentive and, frankly, rude. It was clear they were not interested in making sure we had a good time. This place could have so much potential, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Fortunately, I won’t be coming back or bringing anyone here again.",en,en,,,4,2025-03-29T22:25:03.702Z,9
"Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar& karaoke (Town Center)","4830 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,"I was excited to try out this karaoke venue, especially given my appreciation for Japanese culture. The atmosphere initially seemed high-tech and promising, and I appreciated the convenience of using YouTube for song selection. However, the service was some of the worst I’ve experienced at any establishment.

Despite my friends ordering drinks, they waited 45 minutes without receiving them. The staff frequently disrupted our experience—one employee even interrupted my performance mid-song, speaking over me as I continued singing. At another point, the microphones were abruptly turned off with no explanation. For a paying customer, this level of service was unacceptable.

Overall, while the concept and setup had potential, the unprofessional and inattentive staff completely undermined the experience. I cannot recommend this venue unless serious improvements are made.",en,en,,,4,2025-03-29T21:11:04.744Z,41

There seemed to be enough wait staff even after the crowd arrived. I've worked in the restaurant industry for many years, so I have very little sympathy if a restaurant can't do it right. With that being said, this has always been a rule in the restaurant world: If a customer does not order any appetizers, then their food needs to be all cooked relatively the same time and come out the relatively same time! If you did not know this, then you were poorly trained. It should never be that a dish comes out, then 20 minutes later, the second dish comes out; then 15 minutes later, the third dish comes out.",en,en,,,4.3,2025-06-18T02:24:21.469Z,76
Jade Villa Chinese Restaurant,"353 Independence Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"A Portal to Authentic Chinese Cuisine Hiding in Plain Sight
For years, I treated Jade Villa as my go-to for fantastic, American-style Chinese food. Their General Tso's is top-tier, the beef and broccoli is always fresh and crisp, and the service is consistently warm and welcoming. It has always been a reliable five-star spot in my book for just that. But a recent visit transformed my entire understanding of this neighborhood gem.
During a conversation with one of the incredibly friendly owners, I mentioned my travels in Asia and my love for the cuisine there. A smile spread across their face, and they returned to the table with a different menu, one not typically handed to every customer. This was the key to a completely different world. This ""secret"" menu was filled with dishes you'd find on a family's table in Hong Kong or a bustling eatery in Guangzhou – items that might seem ""weird"" to some, but are the heart and soul of authentic Chinese cooking.
We decided to be adventurous and dive in. We ordered the braised chicken feet in black bean sauce, something I hadn't enjoyed since a trip abroad. They were phenomenal—tender, gelatinous, and packed with savory flavor. We also tried the salt and pepper squid, which was perfectly crispy without being greasy, and a soul-warming bowl of century egg and pork congee that was the ultimate comfort food. It was like being transported thousands of miles away.
What makes Jade Villa truly exceptional is that they masterfully cater to two different worlds. They execute the American Chinese classics with a freshness and quality that is hard to beat, while also offering a genuine taste of Asia for those willing to ask. The staff is more than happy to guide you through the traditional menu with pride. If you think you know Jade Villa, I urge you to ask about their other menu. You'll discover it's not just a great Chinese restaurant; it's a culinary passport. An absolute five-star treasure!",en,en,,,4.3,2025-06-14T10:03:01.053Z,505

A woman answered and said hello yes. I said is this Chinese food? She says yes what do you want? I thought that was rude but over looked that because I was hungry. So I asked her to explain the menu specials, because I had the menu in front of me, and she got frustrated. She put the phone down and came back asking again what do you want? I was upset. I said well I need more info about your menu so I can tell you and she said well call me back when you know what you want. And actually hung up on me. I was appalled. So I called back and she answered the same as before. I said yes I just called, and she says I know who you are what you want?! I still made my order nonetheless and she got my order right and wrong. A simple chicken and white rice was turned into a chicken with fried rice and my daughter hates fried rice and that was her meal I had purchased for her. I actually was going to go to the restaurant and see who she was because her attitude SUCKED so bad If I want food I hesitate and deliberate for hours with my husband before we order.

The Yaming Yaming had a perfect balance of flavors, the Tiger Roll was fresh and flavorful, the Golden Lobster was rich and indulgent, the Jaguar Roll had a nice spicy kick, and the Phoenix Roll was an absolute standout.

The sushi (avocado and sweet potato for me since I'm vegan) was very good. The kitchen food was not as good. The noodles had excessive sesame oil. They have no vegan salad dressings and could only offer me vinegar. They used soft tofu instead of firm for the tofu teriyaki.

The server was friendly,  informative, and helpful.  However,  no one ever removed a dirty dish from our table.  We kept stacking them up on the end of our table when we were done with them. They were still there when we left after paying our bill and finishing our drinks.

The Frog Sports Bar & Grill,"4848 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,4,"Love this little Bar. Mostly because it has Queens machines. .and I like the playing somewhat incognito vs. Seeing same Ole people at the 711 Machines.  I did go in here 1 day to test my luck and only had $1. The Batender or waitress approached me so rudely and said IF you don't buy anything,  you are loitering so you will have to leave. I SAID , ""Soooo .. I have to cash my dollar out I guess ..right? She said...Yes!, unless you buy a drink or something, other then that you have to go. I r hought joa ruse this lady was! For one its not loitering just because I didn't purchase something, didn't mean that I was loitering.  I had $1 ..I was obviously trying to take a shot àt my luck and  get more money...instead I was rudely kicked out! And I was told later by others that I  wasn't the first person she's don't that to.

If we would all realize ...that we need each other in this world...it wouldn't be full of nastydecisiibs.",en,en,,,4.2,2022-08-19T08:26:24.785Z,18

Jade Villa Chinese Restaurant,"353 Independence Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"A great place to try the real deal Chinese food.  This place is definitely for foodies. Protip: Order off of the red menu, not the white menu.  While this place closed last year, it has since reopened under new management but has not lost a step.  They've modernized the place with a new floor, new ceiling tiles, new walls.  The food tastes just the same, excellent.  If you want beef and broccoli or shrimp lo mein, go to any other place, although you can get those items if you want.  They also do dim sum on Sundays especially.  The staff are polite and professional.  They are following current respiratory hygiene guidelines.  Recommended.",en,en,,,4.3,2024-10-31T23:40:33.126Z,510

The reason I am giving 3 star, is the lady in the kitchen, which is open, cooks with her hair not covered, that is a BIG NO in the restaurant world, if a piece of hair fall into food that is a disaster.
Second the atmosphere is not great and place smelled moldy like an old motel with poor look, owner needs to put some $ to renovate. These two things shut me down and made me not enjoy my meal as I used to, I will unlikely go back.",en,en,,,4.5,2025-06-28T04:28:52.660Z,1

Mazari Kebab & More,"676 N Witchduck Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"It was takeout so I couldn’t rate the service and atmosphere but the restaurant looks clean and good when I went to pick it up.
But the food is amazing, I had so much in my plate (chicken kebab platter) with rice and two sides and they were not greasy or not the kind of food that makes you feel guilty from eating. Chicken seasoning was on point, kabuli rice was good I had fries and steamed vege with it. 100 percent would definitely come back.
My husband got the kobida gyro with chickpeas and tomato and cucumber salad as add ons. He loved all of them. I only got pix of my husband’s order cos I was hungry.

Updated:
I did pick up order again and this time I had lamb chop platter. I recommend the eggplant as a side as it is flavorful. Good portion of lamb chops and very tender. We also ordered falafel.
My recommendations
-lamb chop platter
-chicken kebab platter
- gyro (beef and lamb are good)
- eggplant as a side",en,en,,,4.5,2025-06-26T23:13:30.609Z,61

"Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar& karaoke (Town Center)","4830 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"I recently visited Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar & Karaoke, and had an amazing experience from start to finish. Our waitress, Jasmine, made the evening even better with her friendly and attentive service. She was personable, checked in regularly, and ensured everything was just right—without ever being overbearing.

The food was top-notch. We started with some delicious appetizers that set the tone for the meal—everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The grilled items were cooked to perfection. Each dish felt carefully prepared and really elevated the dining experience.

The karaoke bar was lively and in full swing while we dined, adding an extra fun vibe to the atmosphere. Though I didn’t take part in the karaoke this time, the energy in the room was contagious. I’m already planning my next visit and, who knows, maybe I’ll give a song or two a try!

Overall, Volcano Sushi, Grill, Bar & Karaoke exceeded my expectations, and I’m excited to return. Great food, great service, and a lively ambiance make it a spot worth coming back to.",en,en,,,4,2024-12-15T20:48:30.921Z,45

Jade Villa Chinese Restaurant,"353 Independence Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on the reviews, but I was very let down by both the service and the food.
When me and my family arrived, it took five minutes for the waitress to seat us. I would’ve understood if they were busy, but there were only two other tables occupied and they already had their food. After we sat down, we waited another five minutes for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink, just for her to take another couple of minutes to give them to us. Then after waiting almost 20 minutes, we had to flag down another waiter because our waitress forgot about us. It also took a long time for them to bring utensils and plates that we needed.
We ordered the creamy corn soup and the hot and sour soup for the appetizer. Both appetizers were flavorless.
For the entree, we ordered the hunan shrimp, fried rice, pepper steak, and pork and shrimp shumai. The hunan shrimp and the pepper steak were ok, but the fried rice was underseasoned. As for the pork and shrimp shumai, it had an odd taste and it lacked flavor and sauce. I am highly disappointed",en,en,,,4.3,2024-07-04T01:58:31.405Z,12

There were waiters who saw us, but they didn't say a word, as if they didn't see us. And there was a gentleman who stood and looked forward all the time.
I understand that different positions have different service scopes, but you can at least say hello or wait a moment. But there was no one.

Because we don't want to waste our time in a place with such terrible service attitude. So after standing there for a few minutes, we decided to leave. I don't think this restaurant is worth coming to, at least on this day.",en,en,,,4.3,2024-07-03T16:05:24.876Z,3

Hong Kong House,"928 Diamond Springs Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,2,"I'm hoping they were just off today, but (barring the chicken wings) the food looked and tasted as if it were cooked in OLD oil. There was a distinct taste of grease that had been used too often/not changed. The wonton soup was lacking salt...a tad flavorless. But it was ok. It was really the beef lo mein and fried rice that were off-putting. The 2 chicken wings were good. 👍🏽 Clearly they were cooked differently than the rest of the meal. Even in the picture you can see how DARK the lo mein and fried rice are. 😒
It's disappointing, because I've been trying to find a good 'chinese food' restaurant close by. Guess my search might have to continue. But hoping that maybe it was an off day... I'll possibly try them out one more time.",en,en,,,4.2,2025-04-18T04:27:56.901Z,309

Fu Hing Restaurant,"5635 Princess Anne Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,3,"*Editing review after receiving such a nice reply from the restaurant. It appears that my experience was mainly caused by the app and not the restaurant itself. I would still recommend contacting customers directly just to make sure they understand the status of their orders, but I do appreciate the response and the kindness of the business in regard to this review.*

I have ordered from this place 3 times and never had a good experience.  The food is fine, but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired.

The first two times I ordered, delivery took over 90 minutes both times. I went months without ordering and then ordered again tonight, hoping that the other times were a fluke. I use the app Beyond Menu to order from local Chinese places. Anyway, after waiting another 1.5 hours for this order (I would have called sooner but got distracted with playing with my son), I called them to check on the situation.  They told me they had canceled the order. 😯 The man said it was out of their delivery zone (even though they had delivered to me before), and so he immediately canceled it. Thing is, no one ever notified me. He told me Beyond Menu should have notified me.

After I hung up with him, I called Beyond Menu to make sure I wasn't going to be charged for this. I told them the situation and they explained that when he canceled the order through them, he said ""customer has been notified"". So I waited for 90 minutes for an order that wasn't coming and yet, no one could even give me a phone call to let me know.

Maybe if you're picking up, it's a better experience.  But not worth it to me. We'll stick to Stir Fry Chinese from now on.",en,en,,,4,2021-08-16T16:53:41.681Z,31

I ordered a Bento box with California roll, tempura vegetables and teriyaki chicken with fried rice. My wife order hibachi steak and chicken with fried rice. We also ordered the pick 2 sushi rolls with spicy California roll as well as happy face roll. All this was to go. ALL sushi was extremely fishy, not just in taste but even smelled fishy. Everyone knows California roll is NOT supposed to be fishy in any way or form. The tempura vegetables were so soaked in oil they were inedible. My teriyaki chicken was very bland. Both of our ""fried"" rices were far from fried. They look like maybe either brown rice or they added soy sauce to make the rice turn brown possibly. My wife's steak and chicken was ok but not all that. Needless to say we threw it all out and went to Taco Bell lol. Heck we even tried to feed our dogs the chicken and steak and they would not even touch either! The fried ice cream and the salads were the only things that was edible.

Jade Villa Chinese Restaurant,"353 Independence Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"First off I want to say the service was excellent. It took me almost no time to get seated, the waitstaff were attentive and the food came quickly. I should specify I went at a time when I don’t think they were too busy but still the service was very good. As for the food I had some lo-mein, steamed buns and the sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf. The lo-mein was good, nothing to scream from the rooftops about but definitely enjoyable. The steamed buns were tasty as heck, as was the sticky rice. The buns balanced the sweetness of the dumpling with the savory flavor of the filling, my one criticism was that it felt like it could have used a bit of spice but i just added some of the chili sauce they had on the table to it and it was all good. The sticky rice was tasty, with the umami flavor from the filling suffusing the rice in a way I enjoyed immensely. Overall when compared to other dim-sum restaurants I’ve been to this restaurant is pretty good. However when taking into account the location of this restaurant this restaurant goes from good to pretty darn great. Overall I wholeheartedly recommend",en,en,,,4.3,2024-04-06T21:06:54.737Z,22

Jade Villa Chinese Restaurant,"353 Independence Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"It was my second time here, and I felt so compelled to leave this review. Both times, I went for the weekend dimsum, which runs from 12-3pm, but with different individuals. The first time, I went with a coworker at noon and everything was good that I considered bringing a family member here during his spring break. However, my second visit was very different. This time, we went at around 1 pm and got seated immediately since there was quite a number of available tables. The dimsum carts came around, and we picked up a few items. However, most of them were cold and not even lukewarm. Then not too long afterwards, a fairly young woman with the soup cart stopped by our table. We decided to try one of the soups. However, right before serving us the soup, she sneezed and coughed into her hands. She sneezed multiple times throughout and did not even wear a mask. This sight was difficult for us to process at the time. Right after she set the bowl onto our table, I told another server that we don’t want the soup anymore and told him what the soup server did. Not too long afterwards, another older woman, presumably the manager, came over. She tried to guilt trip us into consuming the soup by saying, “she is going to have to pay if you don’t want it.” My family member told her that she sneezed directly into her hands. The older woman took the soup away and crossed it off from our check. I would like to ask, would they eat something someone else had sneezed on? The lady explained that the soup server had come from China just one month ago, so “she did not know and is new [to America].” She was probably getting paid under the table with cash. Maybe about five minutes later, the soup server came out again and started going around serving soups and coughing and sneezing. This whole thing with the soup server killed our appetites. My second time shows that this restaurant does not have any regard for its diners especially when people’s memory of Covid is still fresh. Besides, the food was not good at all with most of them being cold and with limited options. Very disappointing and will not be back. If you eat here, dine at your own risk. Who knows what actually goes on behind the scenes in the kitchen? If this place was good in the past, it has spiraled downward very quickly. Maybe that is why it was easy to be seated during what should have been a busy lunch time.",en,en,,,4.3,2024-03-03T05:23:08.365Z,35

I’ve called into Chick Fil A Cares, THRICE. how is this still not resolved ??? how does Chick Fil A run a business but leaves it up to the store to handle “customer service” when there is NO SUCH THING ??? so pissed, so annoyed, SHAME.",en,en,,,4.4,2025-09-22T15:39:21.187Z,20

The chicken sandwich was dry and bland, and the bun tasted mass-produced. The mac and cheese was really good, creamy and cheesy, that was my favorite part of the meal. The sweet tea was about 75% ice, and wasn't very sweet. For $13.10, there are other food options I would rather enjoy.

Went through the drive thru ordered 2 large waffle fries with extra packs of salt and 2 large cokes. The cokes were good but the fries were warm not hot and they tasted old also did not give us extra salt which we asked for. Because we drove off down the road before tasting we did not go back which was a mistake. I love Chick-fil-a and eat their often.

Suphan Thai is nothing short of exceptional. From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming atmosphere that sets the tone for a truly authentic Thai dining experience in a casual spot.

The food is phenomenal — bursting with rich, layered flavors that transport you straight to Thailand.

What truly sets Suphan Thai apart, though, is the people. The staff are incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely care about making your experience special. It’s the kind of service that makes you feel like family — friendly without being overbearing, and always eager to share a recommendation or a smile.

I came for my husband bday . I brung 16 people there to rent out the karaoke room . They told me it was 34$ when i got my tab it was 68$ per hour . My food was freezing cold . They forgot about one persons food , while everyone else ate . They charged me for two hours when we all had to send something back . My daughter got a sprite and everyone got their drink , she got hers 40 mins later after we had to remind them . One of our mics was dying . So
It kept cutting off . Then they never came to , ask about refills , water , drinks , left all the trash on our table and we was there 2 hours . The building was nice , but the service and food SUCK !! I saw the drinks on the menu that was sooo cute . On the menu was no pics so I asked what did she recommend , bring me a nice looking drink. She suggested a drink that has a bubble on it . Bring us a drink with no bubbles. I asked what happened she said its hard with the bubble and walking over the drink .
So i said then why promote that it has a bubble . I was so irritated . Then the bar tender came with the bubble . Definitely should of got a refund for that . Its someones birthday. We traveled to come there . And they act like they didn’t want to work . Soon as we got in there it wasnt set for my party amount . So for
30
Mins we was looking stupid and awkward. Im going to share on my Tiktok so none of my followers go to this place ever . NOT WORTH THE MONEY ,
DO NOT BRING A LARGE PARTY . And when leaving they start cleaning the entrance and my sister fell .. THE MAN SAID I TOLD THEM NOT TO MOP YET . I told them they need to write an incident report . He looked confused!!! And bring out a receipt pad .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY . By myself i spent over 300$ so im sure they made good money for a party of 16",en,en,,,4,2023-12-05T14:19:52.770Z,13

The menu is extensive and the dining room looks great. The appetizers were great. While I liked the presentation, the sushi rolls were average. The main issue with Volcanos is the lack of an ""all you can eat"" menu. For the quality and taste, $15-20 per roll is simply too expensive.

For appetizers we got the papaya salad's, it inclusion of tomatoes and shrimp proves a thoughtful and effective enhancement.
Then we also got the lettuce wrap and it was exceptionally delicious. It possessed a distinct flavor profile, prompting us to inquire about its ingredients with the owner. Notably, the combination of lemon grass and kaffir lime leaves contributed to its unique and addictive taste.
For the main course, we shared the stir-fry chicken basil, which was exceptionally flavorful and freshly prepared!
For dessert, our favorite sticky rice with mango was just right - perfect sweetness and so fresh!
Also, if you like a little kick, it's recommended to get level 1 - just right and addicting!

The crust is so limp that you can't pick up the small square cuts. The pizza was covered in sauce. This makes those $1 pizzas in the gocery stores look absolutely gourmet!

The employees are the opposite of the true Chick-fila-A standard, never get a “my pleasure” much less a you’re welcome. Smallest nuggets I have ever seen and cold fires within minutes of getting the order.

Please do yourself a favor and drive a little up the road to the Haygood location. World of difference on level of service and better quality food. Corporate needs to come in and turn this place around.",en,en,,,4.4,2025-04-17T00:21:58.314Z,8

Chick-fil-A,"4752 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,3,"This is the second time I have parked, walked in, and asked for a 5 pk of fresh chicken nuggets and a small chicken noodle soup. Right after I received my change, my food was handed in a bag. They did not ask if I was going to dine-in... I asked them if my nuggets were straight from the grease and was assured they were. NOPE, THEY WERE WARM, BUT NOT HOT! As much as one pays for fast food or just food in general, we should receive what we ask for even if we have to wait. I have no problem with that! It's the fact that they looked me in the face and said they just came up. Came up from the hot box, but not the grease! If you want my business, you must earn it, and please do not lie to my face when you know that they didn't! The Mgr was quick to take my bag and place it in the trash and said it would be a few minutes. I waited and received what I paid for, but as far as an apology or saying something to me about their mess up, silence was what I received! When I finally got handed the bag, I didn't receive the sauce that I asked for for the nuggets. The Mgr. was irritated and placed two in the bag as if I was wrong for asking! No, thank you, come again, he just went to a young lady that was on her phone, and they continued their conversation. GET IT TOGETHER, CHICK-FIL-A! You may be the only place that serves REAL chicken, but that does not mean that an Ole lady like myself will not go back! AND IT IS WORD OF MOUTH THAT WILL GIVE OR TAKE BUSINESS FROM YOU! The younger generation is so intrigued with what is on their phones that they have forgotten what they are supposed to do, and that is CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEIR JOB! Thank you for reading this review and please hit the heart if you have had an experience like this! Much ♥️ and respect, Shawn",en,en,,,4.4,2025-04-14T14:32:30.474Z,151

Last time i ordered, i called the store AT LEAST 4 times, wasting over an hour on the phone on hold (no, they never answered) for food that was 3 HOURS late smh. I called the next day and the manager Rondell was one of the most disrespectful individuals i have ever come across in the customer service field. Tonight, I scheduled an order to be delivered at 815pm at like 645pm. Order went in the oven around 745p. Yes, i use the pizza tracker. My order SAT at the store and the Dominos driver (not doordash or some crap like that) arrived at my door with cold pizza at 850pm. They ignored the instructions to make sure they add the garlic crust. And yes, it is already in the order but they almost always forget it. The driver was kind and patient. He called me after he left and told me to call the store because he told Tanya, the manager, about my order because i told him when i felt the cold pizzas. Been on hold for 23min so far, still no answer. I will NEVER order from here again. I know Sals is more expensive, but the pizza tastes better and they saved the day when i ordered from Dominos the last time. While waiting for a 3 hour late dinner, I ordered Sals after Dominos was an hour late, and got my food here, i got my kids fed and in bed BEFORE Dominos even came.

Suphan Thai Cuisine,"928 Diamond Springs Rd Suite 112, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",Virginia Beach,5,"Ah, Suphan Tai Cuisine. An elusive dance of sweet, spicy, sour, and savory—only a true orchestrator can bring such elements into harmonious balance. And yet, my dear readers, I must admit that my recent encounter with this particular establishment was not defined by the cuisine itself, but rather by the circumstances that prevented me from indulging in it. You see, I did not eat there. No tantalizing aroma wafted from my plate, no morsel graced my taste buds. However, it is not the absence of food that defines this review but rather the presence of something equally nourishing—the spirit of welcome.

From the moment I stepped foot onto Suphan Tai Cuisine's charming exterior, I was enveloped by an atmosphere that was warm, unpretentious, and, dare I say, inviting. The staff, though deprived of the chance to present their culinary prowess, demonstrated hospitality of the rarest kind—hospitality that extends beyond the meal itself. They offered me not a menu, but a smile; not a dish, but an experience. They permitted me to capture the essence of their establishment in a photograph—a gesture that, though small, spoke volumes.

I may not have dined within their walls on this occasion, but it was made clear to me that Suphan Tai Cuisine is a place worth returning to—a place where kindness is served alongside the food, and the ambiance lingers long after you’ve left. Indeed, my journey here is not complete, and it is with great anticipation that I shall return, eager to partake in the symphony of flavors that await. Until then, I carry with me the memory of a welcome so genuine that it almost felt like a meal in itself.",en,en,,,4.6,2024-09-28T21:46:54.380Z,133

No sight of my waitress, never bothered to ask how things are, finally someone asked to remove my empty plates and I asked about getting the biscuits heated up.  This of course took forever too and still no sign of my waitress.  Finally I got up to go to the register to pay.  This is about the only saving grace, someone finally came to help me and when I asked to just pay for my food they said not to worry about it.

Save your money and time and go elsewhere.  It is obvious this store needs an entire overhaul and new management who will hold their staff accountable.",en,en,,,3.4,2025-10-12T15:07:20.445Z,62

Shake Shack Virginia Beach,"296 Constitution Dr, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"10/10 on the Osiris Hotness Scale 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Shake Shack on Virginia Beach Boulevard is an excellent spot! The food was absolutely great—fresh, flavorful, and perfectly prepared. I really appreciated how smooth and efficient the ordering process was through the machine. Everything was simple and easy, and my order was delivered right to the table in a timely manner.

The seating area was also a highlight. I enjoyed the outdoor seating, which gave the visit a relaxed and comfortable vibe—perfect for enjoying a good meal. The entire place felt clean, organized, and well-managed, which made the experience even better.

Between the tasty food, efficient service, and comfortable seating, I’d definitely rate this Shake Shack a solid 10/10 on the Osiris Hotness Scale! 🔥 Highly recommend it for anyone in the Virginia Beach area looking for a casual spot with great food and smooth service.

Waited on fairly quick delivery only for the delivery person to get here with the pizza and wings and say that they aren't allowed to accept $50 bills from customers and couldn't/wouldn't give me my pizza and wings.. mind you my total was $38 and I even was willing for him to keep the $50 if giving change was the issue... tried calling the store twice and no answer.. if that's the case...why isn't anything listed on the website except that driver carries no more than $20 for change??? And why aren't delivery drivers given counterfeit markers if you're worried about possibly accepting counterfeit bills???? You need to put on your website that 'exact change' is expected so people don't give you more than what you're willing to take... or that you only accept certain bills😑

Thee Soulfood Kitchen,"5957 E Virginia Beach Blvd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,3,"I've ordered from here quite a few times. The fried chicken is always good. That's normally my go to, and they have a great lunch special where you can get three wings and two sides.

The food here is hit or miss in my opinion. Three items in particular that tend to be good some days and bad other days include the macaroni and cheese, the yams, and the turkey wings.

Sometimes the yams are delicious and other days they're mushy and dry. The last time my mother ordered them, she said the yams tasted like they were days old. The turkey wings are also dry sometimes. I personally think some of their dishes being dry may have something to do with the heat lamp the food is sitting under. I think it dries certain foods out.

The mac and cheese has its inconsistencies too. Today, we picked up a half tray of mac and cheese and green beans. The green beans were OK, but the mac and cheese was watery and tasted like they added too much pepper. My sister had to add more cheese, garlic and onion powder, and smoked paprika, then baked it a little longer. Our family said it tasted much better after she made some changes.

I would go back for individual meals but not for catering. The quality of the food is just too inconsistent to rely on for events, sadly.",en,en,,,3.9,2025-10-05T01:13:50.024Z,20

Made an online order for 2 pizzas, and one came underdone, and the other uncut. Both ice cold. Called the store, and they said they would remake the order. An hour and 15 minutes go by, so I call again. They said the driver came and knocked on the door, but no one knocked on my door since I live in an apartment i can clearly hear, and I was next to my front door the entire time. When i explained that, she literally said “I am telling you that he knocked on the door.” She also would not let me speak. So when I tried asking for a fresh order, she said I would have to come pick it up. It’s odd how they gaslit me, was rude, then tried to make me come to them after screwing up TWICE.

My time showed it was out at 8:47 but hadn't arrived when I called at 9:05. The person answered my call and said, it was leaving out shortly. So the tracker changed that it left the store at 9:15 and would arrive at 9:37.  I called back with my complaint and the manger gave me a $25 credit.  Because they only had two drivers and they where very busy, but my food would artive soon. When my food arrives at 9:39 my pizza is cold and they forgot to send my breadsticks to go with my pasta.

Called the store and told the person who answered the phone. Per the manger they couldn't send because they gave me a $25 credit due to my food only costing $14. So what they are saying, is thats its OK to forget your order when they give you a credit.

The first time, they closed at midnight and I ordered at 9:30 or so, it got to quality check, was there for an hour+ then it was cancelled at 11. It wasn't even midnight yet. And I ordered HOURS before closing time. The second time, was tonight, I ordered nearly 2 hours ago, the food was made fast, but it sat in quality check for 1.5 hrs of that 2 hours and they only had 1 driver, which honestly. Regardless how many deliveries you have. It shouldn't take almost 2 hrs for a driver to complete a few deliveries. So I call to ask if it could be remade and get to me soon, or would I have to wait ANOTHER nearly 2 hours to which they said, yes they could remake it. But it would probably be the same amount of time. And honestly. I won't be ordering from here again. 0-2, all the staff needs to be fired and new staff hired because none of them clearly know how to run an efficient store nor do they know wth is going on apparently.

Service was extremely poor, I spent a week in the hotel next to it and I didn't get noticed after 15 minutes on average. The breakfast meals are extremely basic and very overpriced.

Extremely understaffed.

Don't recommend you pay for the food nor pay extra for the rooms that give you the coupon, because the coupon barely covers the total cost of the meal.

The best, most authentic, most flavorful Thai food my husband and I have found in the area. Hands down the closest to the food we ate in Bangkok. Cathy the owner is cooking right in sight, and her daughter Ashley is so incredibly helpful and kind. We went with our two year old son, and they had a child's fork for him and were wonderful sports about him loudly squealing about how much he loved his food.

We had the larb (great flavor), pad Thai (actually contains vegetables!! Amazing amount of flavor compared to the rather bland version often offered), red curry (lots of vegetables, well seasoned, incredibly flavorful) and sticky rice (absolutely perfect - I think we finished it in 30 seconds).

Highly recommend.",en,en,,,4.6,2023-09-10T00:47:40.214Z,19

The spring rolls were flavorless without the sauce. [Maybe this is how they are suppose to be]. 🤷🏽‍♀️ I do LOVE the Thai basil! The cucumber salad was phenomenal, but you only get a tablespoon portion worth of it. The other dish I ordered was just ok. The spice levels [even the lowest one] are extremely high, so I should have opted out. I only had a brief interaction with a staff member there, but she had a lovely demeanor. 😊",en,en,,,4.6,2023-09-08T15:29:03.227Z,309

I was very disappointed with the portion size. As you can see in the picture, the dinner portion for $15.95 was disappointing due to the fact that the food only fill up the container 1/2 way. No wonder the takeout bag felt very light. I’m usually satisfied after eating a dinner’s portion of Pad See Ew but I’m still hungry due to the small portion. I’m also used to the wider and thicker noodles. This is the 1st time I’ve had this type of skinnier and thinner noodles. The flavor of the food was decent.

My last few experience have been terrible . I ordered pizza for my children and the bottom of both pizzas were still doughy. I spent $30 on my order and even tipped the driver $5 . I call to make a complaint and they said it would take 2 hrs to get the order remade . I asked them about a credit and said they would only do a $5 credit . I’ve ask to speak to the manager and have been waiting for over 10 minutes .

Update after waiting on hold forever they gave me a $25 credit , next time I’ll do digiorno instead of dominions .

New review :

09/27/24
Time : 7:34 pm

I know yall probably wondering why im writing a second review and i hat that this is the ONLY dominos delivery in my area . After tonights episode . I just recommend corporate to just go ahead and close this all together at this point . This is beyond poor service and i actually took my 1 star back . Today with the long wait hours i order the pizza before i even left work and hoping that by the time i got cash and picked my children from daycare for movie night. Maybe the pizza would be on “dominos “ time .t another FAIL i order my pizza at 5:00 and the pizza still didnt get here two hours late ! Not only was it late . Theyre out here delivering our pizza with big size poodles in the back seat ! Dominos i know this isnt your reputation cause its MAINLY bad service just from this location that is out right sad . Not only will i be emailing, calling corporate but i will also be contacting THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING .

Domino's Pizza,"368 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Every time I place an order at this location I have an issue. The past few times I’ve ordered they’ve been late, one time being almost 2 hours after I placed the order when the time was estimated to take under an hour. This past time on 09/01/24 I placed an order at 11pm, they were still taking online orders and stated online they did not close until 12am this day. My order was accepted and said they were prepping it, 15 minutes later it was canceled. So at 11:15 I place the order again, again it goes through and even said they were prepping it. The delivery time was also going down as if they were working on it. At 11:52 the order was suddenly canceled again. I wouldn’t usually complain about something like this but I am currently pregnant and was really craving Dominos. I also tip very well each time, well above 20% so it’s really frustrating when there’s an issue every single time. Do better Dominos.",en,en,,,3,2024-09-02T04:09:16.015Z,4

Ashley's On Greenwich,"5655 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,Quality of food was great. But way too pricey. And the service was terrible. Not once did our server ask how our meals were. My wife and son both got cola to drink. They came in some small wine glass with no ice and no straw. We were never asked if we would like desert. They server just took our plates when we finished eating and came right back with our check. And my wife paid with a credit card and the server brought the card itself back but no receipt. After all that it made total sense why there where only two tables there for dinner beside ours. The restaurant was absolutely empty. The bartender was great though. Very attentive. When I finished my beer she was quick to come to our table and ask if I would like another. I never had to wait on a drink. As I said. The food was very good.

At this point we still haven't gotten our food we paid for and it's been over 2 hours since I ordered. On top of that when we asked to speak with the manager they refused to get on the phone with us and we were told either you get cold pizza and it gets delivered whenever, we remake it and the pizza takes even longer to get here or last but not least we can get our food tomorrow for free. It's not free- they didn't offer a refund all they offered was for us to not have food tonight so that they don't have to deliver to us.

After making 3 or 4 plates she came back to the register and asked what else for the order. This should’ve been my sign to go elsewhere but I was tired and ready to eat so I proceeded to order the seafood platter with Mac and cabbage. The crab cake had a weird taste that made it inedible. The shrimp and whiting were not seasoned at all but I put some tartar sauce on it and made the best of it because I couldn’t even eat the sides. The Mac and cheese were just bland noodles with cheese thrown on top and it was so soupy.

Why do they even have a “well done” option in customize? It would help to have the option “not well-done” instead

————————————-
This has been the 4th or 5th time in a row that my burger patties have been cooked well done, which I never request. While the burger is still enjoyed well done, they would be more enjoyed if they weren’t well done. This won’t necessarily stop me from buying their burgers but they should work on getting better at cooking non well done patties.",en,en,,,4.1,2025-04-24T17:36:28.591Z,15

Ashley's On Greenwich,"5655 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,3,"Ashley's is a comfortable and nicely appointed bar/restaurant inside the Holiday Inn on Greenwich Rd. The service was excellent, the seating comfortable, and the food was tasty.  The menu is a bit limited, and a bit pricey compared to similar restaurants, i.e. Ruby Tuesday's, Applebee's, Chili's,  etc. We both had the classic burger with fries. Mine medium rare, and my friend's medium, and they were cooked perfectly! The fries were good and semi crispy, not soggy at all, and they had some kind of seasoning on them reminiscent of bbq potato chips. The burgers came with lettuce, tomato and red onion,  with mayo on the side, and a dill pickle spear. I lucked out because my friend doesn't like onions or dill pickles, so I got hers! Our burger meals were $11 each. Any other menu options were similarly priced or higher. They don't have good prices on wine or beer or cocktails,  so we just opted for ice water, which was regularly refilled. Our server was prompt, professional and informative, and our food came out within 8-10 minutes. We were the only table for lunch, but they were doing a brisk take out business at the hostess stand, and there were a couple of people at the bar. Nice place for basic bar food in a comfortable and quiet setting. Service stood out more than the food. We may go again because it is so close to my office, but we will probably get salads with chicken or salmon, or perhaps 2 appetizers to share, like quesadillas and sliders.  Great option if you're staying at that hotel, as they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. AND the ladies restroom was very nice, and clean! Lol.",en,en,,,3.3,2019-10-18T18:09:16.009Z,59

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"Tonight my family and I were at top golf to celebrate my brothers birthday. From start to finish I had a wonderful time. Although I did notice that the bar was understaffed, especially for a holiday weekend. But I also recognize and understand that staff may have called out for the holiday weekend. Beyond that, it was a great evening!!!

Every. Single. Staff member that I came in contact with tonight met me with a positive attitude and a smile. Anything that slightly went misarray was dealt with and handled with care, compassion, and a smile.
Tonight the entire grid that va beach top golf was on lost power. The staff was prompt to check on and care for and update the guests on what to expect, continuously and frequently, while also maintaining a smile and positivity. From front desk check in staff, to bartenders, to food runners, to servers, to busters, to management, and anyone there that was working went above and beyond to ensure that all guests were taken care of, communicated with, and made to feel safe.

As someone who has been in the industry for many years, I am so HAPPY, PROUD, ELATED, FIST PUMPS IN THE AIR!!!! (It’s tee shirt time) of how this establishment handled the fiasco of losing power. They worked as a team and kept smiles on their faces.

Top golf also did not charge us for our “bay rental” and are covering all tabs (at least for my “party” as far as I know) and I was astonished by this act. This is something the company should be proud of, even if it means losing out sometimes. Instead of being “money hungry” they made sure everyone there was FIRST AND FOREMOST ***SAFE**** but they also did not allow the stress and pressure of a MAJOR power outage ruin their guests nights. And that says A LOT for a major corporation.

****** But the immediate MANAGEMENT AND STAFF IS WHO DESERVE ALL THIS CREDIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ******** THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE MADE THIS LOCATION STAND OUT!!!! And if it were not for our local neighbors and community working here, it wouldn’t be what it is! ******

SO DONT FORGET THAT CORPORATE!!! IT IS **OUR LOCALS** DOING THIS AND PROVIDING A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!!!
They are absolute ROCKSTARS!!!!!

I HOPE YOU ARE ALL PROUD OF YOURSELVES TONIGHT!!!!! <3
(Because you absolutely should be!)

My family was in booth 229 & 230 this evening (8/30/2025) and I would also like to highlight how wonderful and kind our server was tonight. I don’t remember his name but I do want to make sure he is recognized in this post. Our family thought you did an amazing job tonight and you killed it dude!!! Keep up that same professionalism throughout life and you WILL GO FAR!!!! he was an absolute RoCKsTaR!!!!

Thank you VIRGINIA BEACH TOP GOLF for showing kindness and compassion this evening.  For being prompt to respond to an emergency and to also keep us all *very frequently*  updated with the evening as you all navigated this unexpected disturbance in the night.

You all freaking killed it tonight!!! You all make an amazing team!!! And I’m proud of you all!!!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!

And keep up the great work!!",en,en,,,4.5,2025-08-31T10:49:32.254Z,10

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,"My kids were excited to go. We get there after we reserved 2 hours. Well since it’s busy I get that they tell us the bay is busy and we can go soon. 15 minutes later we get to go but lost 15 minutes off the start. I go to desk to ask about the 15 minutes and they reassure me “oh yeah talk to your hostess and they will get a supervisor and you can get your extra 15 minutes”. Talk to server and “oh yeah we can take care of it. Order our drinks, and drinks get dropped off. Wait another 20 minutes for him to come back so we can say we’d like to order food. Mind you he’s taking care of both people next to us, one of which also had an issue and had a supervisor speak with them and then he’s supper attentive to them of course. Food comes, cold French fries, the chicken buffalo dip is cold. Can’t ask him if we can have our food warmed up because once again he doesn’t ever come back to our bay at all to check on us or how the food was. Flies are landing left and right on the cold dip. Yum I can’t wait to dig into it. Kids didn’t have soda for a hour but hey once he did come back we asked for refills and a box for the cold, fly chicken dip. Takes another 20 minutes for said box and sodas. Oh he’s still around but once again taking care of the people next to us, no box no sodas. When he comes back we ask for a supervisor yet again and he says no need he’s got it and can extend our time. Nope wrong again some lady comes and offers us a $15 off coupon for another visit because someone is coming to our bay they reserved it. Crazy that the next people got the bay on time but we didn’t?

Courteous delivery drivers.
1st driver allowed all my toppings to slide to one side, but was pleasant. 2nd driver waited to ask if everything was good, as I was quickly checking for cheese.

Pizza was not as expected.
1st pizza had the toppings slid to one side. The sauce was spicy and not what I ordered. 2nd pizza was supposed to have no cheese, but there was plenty of cheese I had to remove with the too few toppings that had cheese stuck to them. There was no buttery flavored sauce that's supposed to be on the outside crust (on both pizzas). I ordered EXTRA pepperoni, but the pizzas had light pepperoni. ALL THE TOPPINGS WERE LIGHT, or almost none. Both pizzas were Meatzza (all the meats) pizzas, but the 2nd pizza had almost no meat. The dough was good and soft; not burnt.

Hopefully, the reason the cook made the mistakes is maybe they were very tired or having a rough day, instead of the cook's reason for the bad pizza being that they were careless. I like to give people a fair chance. I'm not perfect, either.",en,en,,,3,2024-04-20T20:10:59.878Z,10

If they had just reached out sooner about canceling my order instead of doing it last minute via email I wouldn’t be hungry in my hotel room. Thanks for nothing Dominos.

Domino's Pizza,"368 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,I ordered pizza here for the family as I always do. Waited 3 hours. Called and they did not answer. Called again and an extremely rude woman answered the phone. I explained that we've been waiting for the order for hours. She stated they only had 3 drivers. I said I would be on my way to pick up and asked her to cancel the delivery. She hung up. I called back. No answer. Called back and a man answered. I explained the situation. He stated he understood. I got to the store and the woman that hung up on me was rude and attempted to get a reaction out of me. I did not engage with the woman. I asked for the store owners business card and contact information. I was given a blank card. Sending this to domino's HQ.

I didn’t like it was in a supermarket and don’t understand why I wasn’t able to redeem at the actual restaurant/lounge but when I got to the the customer service they didn’t have my voucher after I called days prior to confirm, then I was only able to get 2 sides with chicken that had to be less than 10 pieces but I got collar green and Mac and cheese, the food was good but it wasn’t $100 worth because I did bring 4 guests and that wasn’t enough, I could’ve gotten bigger and better at KFC or Popeyes, I think they gave me an amount of food for just me which wasn’t right because I won more than that. Me and a another guest immediately had a stomach ache and had to constantly go to the bathroom once we left so it had to be the collard greens but I was very disappointed and will never come to this place again even though it was free it definitely wasn’t worth it especially driving to Norfolk from Hampton, I expected more especially from the radio station.",en,en,,,3.9,2024-07-29T20:25:44.883Z,4
Thee Soulfood Kitchen,"5957 E Virginia Beach Blvd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,4,"Before talking about the food, I can't get past the long wait. We waited in line at least 20-30 min in line just to order, followed by about 10 minutes to get our food (2 dinners and one extra side) for takeout. I'm used to waiting at these kinds of places but what I couldn't understand was why the wait was so long if the food was ready made. There was also a significant amount of time when they weren't taking people from the takeout line, so I guess they were either understaffed or primarily getting food for dine-in customers before moving to the take-out line. It was extremely annoying at the time....

That being said, I'm so glad the food was at least worth it. I decided to try the turkey wings because they looked huge and had a great brown color across the glass. They definitely looked as good as they tasted! The meat was so tender and flavorful and slid right off the bones! The gravy was delicious too! The sides were also pretty good - the rice and gravy was tasty and the mac and cheese wasn't too cheesey, which I prefer. I was sad that they didn't have green beans as indicated on the menu, so I'm glad the mac and cheese was at least good.

Overall, I'm glad the food was good! I just would not come here if I'm really hunger because the wait is brutal.",en,en,,,3.9,2024-07-22T00:23:21.884Z,98

Denny's,"6360 Newtown Rd, Norfolk, VA 23502",Norfolk,3,"Well, I was really disappointed with the food. My husband really wanted waffles,  so that was ordered. They were not good because they had lumps of sugar in every bite. Then when the manager came over she informed us that they don't make them there they just warmed them up. I have had better waffles at a hotel that you make myself. My advice to Denny's is that if you are going to serve waffles do it in house and invest in a waffle iron like the hotel have at the least. They were very insensitive about my husband dislike of the waffles. They didn't do anything to comfort or assure that our visit was pleasant. It's highly highly highly unlikely we will return. It was already quite a while, years to be exact, since our last visit. And this certainly didn't help. Will not recommend Denny's to anyone.",en,en,,,3.4,2024-12-01T18:34:54.410Z,146

Kit is the perfect example of excellent customer service from the time I was seated. She was there immediately to let me know that she would be my waiter and what could she offer me to drink? I asked for water she brought it back immediately. Always had a smile. Every time she greeted my table made very good  eye contact… her manners was out of this world, very sweet, very pleasant very mindful and respectable. I sat back and watched her serve the whole side of where I was sitting by herself not one time. Did she miss a beat of customer service with also checking on all of her customers as well. I really enjoyed my lunch with her today. I wish I could have tipped her more than I did, but sometimes we just don’t have it, but she definitely deserved it. I would like to say thank you for the company for having someone like kit be a server at your restaurant. She really makes the place look really good customer service on excellent and because of her, I will be bringing my whole crew of a birthday party of 25 in two weeks and I would like to request her as at least one of our servers.

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"This a really solid top golf location. The staff, food, golfing, and environment were all excellent. As a non-golfer, can’t speak too much about the atmosphere or golfing, but to me it felt amazing! What I can comment on is the customer service and the food!!!

I don’t usually write reviews, but just as a token of proof to build on what I said: My family was there on vacation and we love top golf! We had ordered food, but for whatever reason it got slightly delayed and our time was about to run out due to the wait. As a result, management came over, gave us a personal apology, 30 additional free minutes to our time, and you could tell they felt bad and were truly sorry about what had happened. The food was also amazing too!

Depending on the person, delay in food can seem like a bad thing (were human, these things happen) or it can seem like a silly thing (not the end of the world). Either way, it’s so rare for me to experience staff at this high of a level who truly showed empathy, kindness, and guilt from the experience, so I had to write a review about it.

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"We usually have a great experience at Topgolf and were really looking forward to celebrating Father’s Day there. While the initial reservation process was smooth, the experience trying to modify it was incredibly frustrating—and the lack of local customer service support made it worse.

Days in advance, I booked two bays online. After some friends canceled, we only needed one. Wanting to free up the second bay for someone else, I called to make the change. The representative informed me that she couldn’t modify the reservation—I’d need to cancel and rebook entirely. She assured me there was still availability at 4:00 PM and that my $60 deposit would be refunded immediately.

Trusting that, I canceled the reservation. When I attempted to rebook, there were no time slots even close to 4:00 PM. I refreshed the site repeatedly that evening with no luck. By the next morning, the waitlist was full. I called again and spoke with Joseph, who offered no real solution or support.

I completely understand that Father’s Day is a busy time—but I followed the directions I was given and still lost my reservation, with no immediate refund and no help to resolve the issue. I wasn’t asking for anything free—just to use the reservation I had already paid for. Extremely disappointing, especially for a day we were looking forward to.",en,en,,,4.5,2025-06-15T17:45:42.566Z,2

There was about 7-10 working  outside in the front LOUD laughing and joking but not working! while sitting in the bar area our server was HORRIBLE. She had blonde short locs she disappeared and went on break but didn’t tell us we had to walk up to the bar to find that out. when she finally came back from break she didn’t acknowledge our table. we had to wave her down and ASK for her to buss our table.

The reservation is fairly affordable if going in a group of at least 4, $22 per person. You can reserve a bay which for us was for 1.5  hours. Next time I'll probably do 2 hours.

Domino's Pizza,"368 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Closest Domino's store in my area for delivery, so I'm kind of at their mercy for delivery. Don't have anything bad to say about their delivery drivers, but the store itself seems to run itself at the most inefficient way they can. To compare with other stores, most are prepped, baked, and delivered within 45 minutes or less. This store is constantly lagging behind order preparation, and can take an hour or more to start baking their food. Been in this area for a about 9 months and I order from them on a monthly basis, results are usually the same. My guess is the management here either has constant staffing issues or they just don't really care about the job; I'm hoping its the former.",en,en,,,3,2023-11-05T01:33:24.067Z,3

I got the catfish basket with sweet potato waffle fries and my mom got the shrimp basket with 3 boiled potatoes and the cajun rice sans sausage. I gave my mom one piece of catfish (which were nice and large) in exchange for two shrimp, also large. The catfish crust was flaky while the meat was wonderfully tender. The shrimp too was fried and seasoned to perfection. The Cajun rice was delish with shrimp and egg and something deliciously chewy that we just assumed was chicken or some other kind of seafood. The music playing was all 90s to early 2000s R&B classics, which set the entire mood to relax, enjoy, and chill mode.

Went there, ordered what looked good which was salisbury steak, rice and gravy, cabbage, and a side order of candied yams.  When I arrived home and prepared to eat it for dinner, I first started to eat the salisbury steak (which were like to large balls), I stuck my folk in it, proceeded to take a bite, and it tasted like ""MUSH"".  The meat crumbled down as if it had been glued together.  It was nasty, along with looking at the yams that had so much syrup in it, that much sugar is dangerous to consume.

They asked us if we were celebrating anything and my husband said we were celebrating our anniversary. I thought they were just making small talk while we checked in but to my surprise a gentleman walked over to us and gave him a little light up ring to give to me and a cardboard cut out of a ring. It was the sweetest little thing that made our day that much more enjoyable while we were there. The only thing I was unsatisfied with was when a server brought out our food, my husband asked for honey mustard for our fries and after 15-30 mins we still did not get any. It wasn’t extremely busy so it was a bit frustrating. However, our actual server Sarah came over to ask how our food was and we expressed our enjoyment for our meals. We asked her for honey mustard and she got it out to us right away. She was a wonderful server! With that being said, thank you top golf for helping us celebrate our special day!

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"We just left this venue and just had to add a review about our awful experience.  We were part of a large party.  My wife and I were there with our granddaughter.  We ordered a flatbread pizza and a kids meal for our granddaughter.  We then watched order after order come out many of which we know were placed after we placed our order.  The waitress never even brought us drinks even after we had asked several times for a glass of water.  After checking again with the waitress who was clearly annoyed with us, we could see that she had forgotten to place our order.  She never once was apologetic and never brought us drinks.  The food was finally delivered by a separate food server and at that point I flagged down the waitress and asked her to get us our check so we could get out of there as quickly as possible.  I tried to explain to her that her service had been very poor and she was quite disrespectful and very annoyed.  I asked her where her manager was and she told me to try to find him.  She was totally disrespectful.  I found the manager and explained how unhappy we were with our experience.  We paid our bill (there was no offer for a discount of any sort but we did not ask for one).  We did not leave a tip at all which is so unusual for us as we are always very generous with our tipping.  Our only hope is that the manager actually spoke with the server so that others would not be subjected to the same type of disrespectful service.",en,en,,,4.5,2025-03-15T22:41:32.855Z,6

This Old House Japanese Restaurant,"309 Aragona Blvd #118, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I really don’t understand why this place is so highly rated. Maybe it’s their entrées certainly not their sushi. I ordered a rainbow roll - pretty basic and something that I’ve had multiple times at other restaurants. I’m not sure if we were there on an off day but what I got was not very good. I’m really sorry I didn’t take a picture of it. It was a roll with large pieces of fish slapped on top of it and maybe people like that, but to me, it wasn’t an elegant way of serving it and quite frankly, the fish wasn’t that great. Overall, we are really disappointed with the quality of the food. There’s not much ambience. It’s actually a little dingy, hence the name old house? Again this was my experience.

Charging a cover of $20 seems a bit steep given the lack of decor and ambiance, especially when you're charging an extra $2. for electronic payments. The DJ understood the assignment, but it's a pretty rambunctious group overall. The bartenders look at you 7 times before saying anything to women. I hadn't been back in years, and I probably won't frequent it. Food prices seemed reasonable. I didn't eat.",en,en,,,4.2,2025-03-25T11:04:58.645Z,27

Burger King (Newtown Rd),"564 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,"I went to burger king with the soul purpose of trying the new fried pickle ranch whopper, this was the second location I drove to tonight because the first one was currently sold out of fried pickles. So of course I was excited that the newtown location had fried pickles! I made it home just to unwrap both the “fried pickles ranch whoppers” I ordered and they have NO fried pickles it overall just feels skimpy the bacon is too soft and chewy and it was nothing more than an extreme disappointment. I made no modifications to the order, fried pickles is in the title of the burger, feels like a laziness not a mistake. We also did not get any sauces, straws, or a receipt. And last time I came to this location they let me put my order, pulled up to the window they immediately handed me my drinks (which were a size too small) and as they’re handing them to me they tell me they’re only accepting cash, told me to “go use the ATM at 7/11 or something and come back for the rest of the food”. Why would they not lead with “before you place you’re order id like to let you know we’re only accepting cash right now” don’t waste my time.",en,en,,,3.2,2024-12-01T23:06:08.973Z,5

Topgolf Virginia Beach,"5444 Greenwich Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Came with a big group (5 bays, 6-7 people per bay). My bay had 7 people, and we all ordered at the same time. Everyone got their food and drinks within 20-25 minutes—except me. I ordered just a beer and it took an hour to arrive.

At 30 minutes, I checked in. Our server—who was handling all five bays alone—said it was coming. At 45 minutes, I checked again, and a curly-haired kid behind him gave me an attitude: “You just need to be patient; he’s the only server for your bays.” Finally, after a full hour, they told me they didn’t even have the beer I want and gave me something else instead. Meanwhile, everyone else had already finished their food and drinks.

Two pieces of advice for management:

1. If you're hosting a large group, assign more than one server. It helps both customers and your business.

They were busy but when we had glitches with our system for the first 30 minutes “Lizzy” the manager did more than make it right for us!  She immediately called for maintenance who was also really nice.  when they couldn’t figure it out she moved us right away and really took care of us. She was so kind and personable and checked on us multiple times. The service our waiter Zachary gave us was amazing. This place has a staff who actually care and for that we will be back.

This Old House Japanese Restaurant,"309 Aragona Blvd #118, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"I was completely misled by the high Google reviews for this sushi restaurant. It felt like a bait-and-switch experience, given its high star rating. Months later, I still vividly recall the disappointment and horror of our meal.

Having enjoyed sushi in California, Asia, and locally in Virginia Beach and Suffolk, I can confidently say this was the worst sushi I’ve ever had. The rolls were poorly constructed, with unevenly cut fish and toppings precariously perched on the rice log. It was a mess from the start.

When we bit into the rolls, the rice was so over-compressed it had the texture of rubber. The raw fish tasted fishy and far from fresh—a major red flag for sushi. To make matters worse, we made the mistake of ordering uni, which was overwhelmingly fishy and unpleasant. I genuinely struggled to swallow it but felt obligated since we had paid for it.

The only redeeming aspect of the visit was the staff, who were incredibly kind. Unfortunately, the food was so bad that we didn’t have the heart to tell them. We simply wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I struggled with whether to write this negative review because I understand how hard it is for small business owners to survive. However, I don’t want others who have had good sushi to go through the same disappointing experience I did, being misled by the high reviews.

Adding insult to injury, we spent over $100 on this terrible meal, making it even more unforgettable.

Those who rated this place four or five stars must have never had real, good sushi. This was, without question, the most unforgettable sushi experience of my life—for all the wrong reasons. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.",en,en,,,4.7,2025-01-08T21:01:04.979Z,18

I must say they must be clean because the bleach smell was STRONG. Someone was mopping. I hope she wears a mask in the future. That bleach can have long-term effects, though I do appreciate the cleanliness.
On to the food. I ordered Jerk chicken, cabbage, and plantains. The Jerk chicken was spicy with a hint of sweetness. I was going to eat only half, but ended up eating more.  The cabbage was a bit different. I've had it with carrots before, but it also had bits of green beans. It was different, yet tasty. They were firm, not mushy, which is how I prefer it. The plantains were good. I prefer them with the crispy ends, but they were still soft and sweet.

This Old House Japanese Restaurant,"309 Aragona Blvd #118, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"Very impressive family sushi restaurant with passion for their food! They put the chain sushi restaurants in the area to shame. Here I started with individual pieces of sushi, and then a Virginia Eel Roll with a bowl of miso soup.

The temperature of the fish was slightly chilled below room temp, so as you eat, it gets to the right temperature for eating sushi. The quality was quite good, not Tsukiji Market good, but good for this region of the US. The rice was at the perfect temp, however, the texture could use improvement. And of course, extremely generous amounts of fish.

It seems like they actually make their miso soup with paste rather than the cheap powdered soup, which is very rare. Only it needs to be tuned down a bit(too much miso), then it'd be perfect.

The hole in the wall vibe is very reminiscent to restaurants in Japan, with menu items posted on the wall. If you lived in Japan before, then this place will give you a bit of notalgia, as if you're walking through the alleys of Yokosuka.

So if you are in the mood for sushi, don't spend your fortune at a restaurant that feeds you more rice than fish, and fish more frozen than chilled.

Charleys Cheesesteaks and Wings,"556 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,"For it being my FIRST time coming to this establishment, and I went through Drive-thru, the cashier did not great me, read back my order, and had the nerve to point out that I could leave her a tip while using my apple pay. Now, I am old school, and I tip heavily when a service has been rendered or performed, but she is a cashier... she is getting paid an hourly amount to make a drink and place napkins and condiments in the bag to which the food was placed by the other male standing in front of the grill. What service did she perform on me to receive a 10% all the way up to 30% tip for a cheesesteak, fries, and a Sprite? 🤔 She didn't acknowledge me as a patron, nor welcomed me to Charlie's. She did not ask me if I needed any extra napkins or any  extra condiments, I had to ask for them. What makes it bad was the cheesesteak was on point, but the fries were not hot and when I asked for Cajun seasoning on them, it looked like they took the shaker and gave them a heavy dose of seasoning just on the top of the fries. There was no seasoning around them or on the fries on the bottom of the box.
Now, you tell me... did she deserve a tip? If I am wrong, I'll admit it, but in this case, it's not like I got a manicure while waiting for my food or she personally came out to give me my food. I was told to wait for 4 minutes for new ones to be made, and I politely told her I did not have the time. Mind you, it is 5:37 p.m. and there is NO reason any establishment should be serving luke warm (at best) fries with seasoning not on each individual fry at this time, which is called dinner or super time! The prices were extremely overpriced, especially for the quantity of fries that you receive. I do not believe in giving my hard earned money to a woman who paid no attention to me, did not greet me, nor asked me if I needed any extra napkins or condiments. I will not tip because you are at your job and doing a horrible representation of what a cashier is supposed to do regardless of where you work. BTW, I paid $21.78 for a regular cheesesteak, fries, and a medium drink!
To the manager of this establishment, if you plan on keeping this place open, you may want to retrain your cashier staff and your cook online. No one should be given fries that are not fresh paying the prices that Charlie's charges! Much luck to you and this business.",en,en,,,3.5,2025-03-19T00:48:06.918Z,151
