Burger King (Newtown Rd),"564 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,5,"It’s currently 10:42 P.M 11/11/2025, and I just left Burger King about 10 minutes ago. I don’t usually leave reviews for fast food places, but I had to today. The man in the drive-thru who took my order was brown-skinned with locs (maybe you can check who was working around this time). There were also two light-skinned guys working that shift that I could see. The man in the drive-thru had top-tier customer service  super friendly and professional. My fries and burger were hot, fresh, and perfectly made, honestly some of the best I’ve had from Burger King in a while. I was really wow’d by the whole experience and just wanted to share and give credit where it’s due! THANK YOU SO MUCH :)",en,en,,,3.2,2025-11-12T03:48:54.316Z,11

Burger King (Newtown Rd),"564 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,1,"Words can NOT express my disappointment. There was only one customer eating inside and no one at the drive through. I waited at the drive through and only heard “hello” then no response. I waited for about five minutes and I almost drove away in the end, I guess this is what I get for being patient. After the five minutes I said “hello?” And the lady said “sorry I forgot about you🙄” with a voice FULL of attitude, then proceeded to make me wait a few more minutes. After I FINALLY placed my order, she was in a RUSH to shove my order out the window. I was handing my sister her drink and I SAW that lady give me the STINK EYE behind me. She didn’t even try to hide it. I turned around to get the bag and she STILL HAD THE STINK EYE EXPRESSION. This is DIABOLICAL. Man I just can’t make this stuff up. I am never coming here again.

In terms of the place itself, it’s just like any other BK I’ve been to.  It was kinda dirty with trash on the floor but that’s about it.

The freestyle coke machine was broken so I had to get my drink from the back which is fine I mean, what else can you expect from BK?  As for the food, I think my whopper caused a small fire in the back.  There was smoke coming from the back which fortunately did go away after a bit.  My whopper was literally steaming and was probably the best whopper I’ve ever had from BK.  And guess what, the thing STAYED hot, you can’t make this stuff up.  The thing caused the print on the wrapper to stick to the table and leave marks

Burger King (Newtown Rd),"564 Newtown Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23462",Virginia Beach,2,"I went to burger king with the soul purpose of trying the new fried pickle ranch whopper, this was the second location I drove to tonight because the first one was currently sold out of fried pickles. So of course I was excited that the newtown location had fried pickles! I made it home just to unwrap both the “fried pickles ranch whoppers” I ordered and they have NO fried pickles it overall just feels skimpy the bacon is too soft and chewy and it was nothing more than an extreme disappointment. I made no modifications to the order, fried pickles is in the title of the burger, feels like a laziness not a mistake. We also did not get any sauces, straws, or a receipt. And last time I came to this location they let me put my order, pulled up to the window they immediately handed me my drinks (which were a size too small) and as they’re handing them to me they tell me they’re only accepting cash, told me to “go use the ATM at 7/11 or something and come back for the rest of the food”. Why would they not lead with “before you place you’re order id like to let you know we’re only accepting cash right now” don’t waste my time.",en,en,,,3.2,2024-12-01T23:06:08.973Z,5

I recently got a burrito from there from DoorDash (too bad you can’t tell them which Burger King to go to) and the tortilla was hard, and wasn’t made right, and I got one a while ago from the same Burger King, and the burrito had mold on it.
